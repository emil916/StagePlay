6|1|PARKER.|Is your ladyship at home this afternoon?
7|1|LADY WINDERMERE.|Yes--who has called?
8|2|PARKER.|Lord Darlington, my lady.
9|2|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Hesitates for a moment.)  Show him up--and I'm at home to any one who calls.
10|3|PARKER.|Yes, my lady.
11|0||(Exit C.)
12|3|LADY WINDERMERE.|It's best for me to see him before to-night.  I'm glad he's come.
13|0||(Enter PARKER C.)
14|4|PARKER.|Lord Darlington,
15|0||(Enter LORD DARLINGTON C.)
16|0||(Exit PARKER.)
17|1|LORD DARLINGTON.|How do you do, Lady Windermere?
18|4|LADY WINDERMERE.|How do you do, Lord Darlington?  No, I can't shake hands with you.  My hands are all wet with these roses. Aren't they lovely?  They came up
19|5|LADY WINDERMERE.|from Selby this morning.
20|2|LORD DARLINGTON.|They are quite perfect.  (Sees a fan lying on the table.)  And what a wonderful fan!  May I look at it?
21|6|LADY WINDERMERE.|Do.  Pretty, isn't it!  It's got my name on it, and everything.  I have only just seen it myself.  It's my husband's birthday present to me.
22|7|LADY WINDERMERE.| You know to-day is my birthday?
23|3|LORD DARLINGTON.|No?  Is it really?
24|8|LADY WINDERMERE.|Yes, I'm of age to-day.  Quite an important day in my life, isn't it?  That is why I am giving this party to-night. Do sit down.  (Still
25|9|LADY WINDERMERE.|arranging flowers.)
26|4|LORD DARLINGTON.|(Sitting down.)  I wish I had known it was your birthday, Lady Windermere.  I would have covered the whole street in front of your house
27|5|LORD DARLINGTON.|with flowers for you to walk on.  They are made for you.  (A short pause.)
28|10|LADY WINDERMERE.|Lord Darlington, you annoyed me last night at the Foreign Office.  I am afraid you are going to annoy me again.
29|6|LORD DARLINGTON.|I, Lady Windermere?
30|0||(Enter PARKER and FOOTMAN C., with tray and tea things.)
31|11|LADY WINDERMERE.|Put it there, Parker.  That will do.  (Wipes her hands with her pocket-handkerchief, goes to tea-table, and sits down.)  Won't you come
32|12|LADY WINDERMERE.|over, Lord Darlington?
33|0||(Exit PARKER C.)
34|7|LORD DARLINGTON.|(Takes chair and goes across L.C.)  I am quite miserable, Lady Windermere.  You must tell me what I did.  (Sits down at table L.)
35|13|LADY WINDERMERE.|Well, you kept paying me elaborate compliments the whole evening.
36|8|LORD DARLINGTON.|(Smiling.)  Ah, nowadays we are all of us so hard up, that the only pleasant things to pay ARE compliments.  They're the only things we CAN
37|9|LORD DARLINGTON.|pay.
38|14|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Shaking her head.)  No, I am talking very seriously.  You mustn't laugh, I am quite serious.  I don't like compliments, and I don't see why
39|15|LADY WINDERMERE.|a man should think he is pleasing a woman enormously when he says to her a whole heap of things that he doesn't mean.
40|10|LORD DARLINGTON.|Ah, but I did mean them.  (Takes tea which she offers him.)
41|16|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Gravely.)  I hope not.  I should be sorry to have to quarrel with you, Lord Darlington.  I like you very much, you know that.  But I
42|17|LADY WINDERMERE.|shouldn't like you at all if I thought you were what most other men are.  Believe me, you are better than most other men, and I sometimes
43|18|LADY WINDERMERE.|think you pretend to be worse.
44|11|LORD DARLINGTON.|We all have our little vanities, Lady Windermere.
45|19|LADY WINDERMERE.|Why do you make that your special one?  (Still seated at table L.)
46|12|LORD DARLINGTON.|(Still seated L.C.)  Oh, nowadays so many conceited people go about Society pretending to be good, that I think it shows rather a sweet and
47|13|LORD DARLINGTON.|modest disposition to pretend to be bad.  Besides, there is this to be said.  If you pretend to be good, the world takes you very seriously.
48|14|LORD DARLINGTON.| If you pretend to be bad, it doesn't.  Such is the astounding stupidity of optimism.
49|20|LADY WINDERMERE.|Don't you WANT the world to take you seriously then, Lord Darlington?
50|15|LORD DARLINGTON.|No, not the world.  Who are the people the world takes seriously?  All the dull people one can think of, from the Bishops down to the bores.
51|16|LORD DARLINGTON.| I should like YOU to take me very seriously, Lady Windermere, YOU more than any one else in life.
52|21|LADY WINDERMERE.|Why--why me?
53|17|LORD DARLINGTON.|(After a slight hesitation.)  Because I think we might be great friends.  Let us be great friends.  You may want a friend some day.
54|22|LADY WINDERMERE.|Why do you say that?
55|18|LORD DARLINGTON.|Oh!--we all want friends at times.
56|23|LADY WINDERMERE.|I think we're very good friends already, Lord Darlington.  We can always remain so as long as you don't -
57|19|LORD DARLINGTON.|Don't what?
58|24|LADY WINDERMERE.|Don't spoil it by saying extravagant silly things to me.  You think I am a Puritan, I suppose?  Well, I have something of the Puritan in me.
59|25|LADY WINDERMERE.| I was brought up like that.  I am glad of it.  My mother died when I was a mere child.  I lived always with Lady Julia, my father's elder
60|26|LADY WINDERMERE.|sister, you know.  She was stern to me, but she taught me what the world is forgetting, the difference that there is between what is right
61|27|LADY WINDERMERE.|and what is wrong.  SHE allowed of no compromise.  _I_ allow of none.
62|20|LORD DARLINGTON.|My dear Lady Windermere!
63|28|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Leaning back on the sofa.)  You look on me as being behind the age.--Well, I am!  I should be sorry to be on the same level as an age like
64|29|LADY WINDERMERE.|this.
65|21|LORD DARLINGTON.|You think the age very bad?
66|30|LADY WINDERMERE.|Yes.  Nowadays people seem to look on life as a speculation.  It is not a speculation.  It is a sacrament.  Its ideal is Love.  Its
67|31|LADY WINDERMERE.|purification is sacrifice.
68|22|LORD DARLINGTON.|(Smiling.)  Oh, anything is better than being sacrificed!
69|32|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Leaning forward.)  Don't say that.
70|23|LORD DARLINGTON.|I do say it.  I feel it--I know it.
71|0||(Enter PARKER C.)
72|5|PARKER.|The men want to know if they are to put the carpets on the terrace for to-night, my lady?
73|33|LADY WINDERMERE.|You don't think it will rain, Lord Darlington, do you?
74|24|LORD DARLINGTON.|I won't hear of its raining on your birthday!
75|34|LADY WINDERMERE.|Tell them to do it at once, Parker.
76|0||(Exit PARKER C.)
77|25|LORD DARLINGTON.|(Still seated.)  Do you think then--of course I am only putting an imaginary instance--do you think that in the case of a young married
78|26|LORD DARLINGTON.|couple, say about two years married, if the husband suddenly becomes the intimate friend of a woman of--well, more than doubtful
79|27|LORD DARLINGTON.|character--is always calling upon her, lunching with her, and probably paying her bills--do you think that the wife should not console
80|28|LORD DARLINGTON.|herself?
81|35|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Frowning)  Console herself?
82|29|LORD DARLINGTON.|Yes, I think she should--I think she has the right.
83|36|LADY WINDERMERE.|Because the husband is vile--should the wife be vile also?
84|30|LORD DARLINGTON.|Vileness is a terrible word, Lady Windermere.
85|37|LADY WINDERMERE.|It is a terrible thing, Lord Darlington.
86|31|LORD DARLINGTON.|Do you know I am afraid that good people do a great deal of harm in this world.  Certainly the greatest harm they do is that they make
87|32|LORD DARLINGTON.|badness of such extraordinary importance.  It is absurd to divide people into good and bad.  People are either charming or tedious.  I take
88|33|LORD DARLINGTON.|the side of the charming, and you, Lady Windermere, can't help belonging to them.
89|38|LADY WINDERMERE.|Now, Lord Darlington.  (Rising and crossing R., front of him.)  Don't stir, I am merely going to finish my flowers. (Goes to table R.C.)
90|34|LORD DARLINGTON.|(Rising and moving chair.)  And I must say I think you are very hard on modern life, Lady Windermere.  Of course there is much against it, I
91|35|LORD DARLINGTON.|admit.  Most women, for instance, nowadays, are rather mercenary.
92|39|LADY WINDERMERE.|Don't talk about such people.
93|36|LORD DARLINGTON.|Well then, setting aside mercenary people, who, of course, are dreadful, do you think seriously that women who have committed what the world
94|37|LORD DARLINGTON.|calls a fault should never be forgiven?
95|40|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Standing at table.)  I think they should never be forgiven.
96|38|LORD DARLINGTON.|And men?  Do you think that there should be the same laws for men as there are for women?
97|41|LADY WINDERMERE.|Certainly!
98|39|LORD DARLINGTON.|I think life too complex a thing to be settled by these hard and fast rules.
99|42|LADY WINDERMERE.|If we had 'these hard and fast rules,' we should find life much more simple.
100|40|LORD DARLINGTON.|You allow of no exceptions?
101|43|LADY WINDERMERE.|None!
102|41|LORD DARLINGTON.|Ah, what a fascinating Puritan you are, Lady Windermere!
103|44|LADY WINDERMERE.|The adjective was unnecessary, Lord Darlington.
104|42|LORD DARLINGTON.|I couldn't help it.  I can resist everything except temptation.
105|45|LADY WINDERMERE.|You have the modern affectation of weakness.
106|43|LORD DARLINGTON.|(Looking at her.)  It's only an affectation, Lady Windermere.
107|0||(Enter PARKER C.)
108|6|PARKER.|The Duchess of Berwick and Lady Agatha Carlisle.
109|0||(Enter the DUCHESS OF BERWICK and LADY AGATHA CARLISLE C.)
110|0||(Exit PARKER C.)
111|1|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|(Coming down C., and shaking hands.)  Dear Margaret, I am so pleased to see you.  You remember Agatha, don't you?  (Crossing L.C.)  How do
112|2|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|you do, Lord Darlington?  I won't let you know my daughter, you are far too wicked.
113|44|LORD DARLINGTON.|Don't say that, Duchess.  As a wicked man I am a complete failure.  Why, there are lots of people who say I have never really done anything
114|45|LORD DARLINGTON.|wrong in the whole course of my life. Of course they only say it behind my back.
115|3|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Isn't he dreadful?  Agatha, this is Lord Darlington.  Mind you don't believe a word he says.  (LORD DARLINGTON crosses R.C.)  No, no tea,
116|4|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|thank you, dear.  (Crosses and sits on sofa.)  We have just had tea at Lady Markby's.  Such bad tea, too.  It was quite undrinkable.  I
117|5|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|wasn't at all surprised.  Her own son-in-law supplies it.  Agatha is looking forward so much to your ball to-night, dear Margaret.
118|46|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Seated L.C.)  Oh, you mustn't think it is going to be a ball, Duchess.  It is only a dance in honour of my birthday.  A small and early.
119|46|LORD DARLINGTON.|(Standing L.C.)  Very small, very early, and very select, Duchess.
120|6|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|(On sofa L.)  Of course it's going to be select.  But we know THAT, dear Margaret, about YOUR house.  It is really one of the few houses in
121|7|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|London where I can take Agatha, and where I feel perfectly secure about dear Berwick.  I don't know what society is coming to.  The most
122|8|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|dreadful people seem to go everywhere.  They certainly come to my parties--the men get quite furious if one doesn't ask them.  Really, some
123|9|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|one should make a stand against it.
124|47|LADY WINDERMERE.|_I_ will, Duchess.  I will have no one in my house about whom there is any scandal.
125|47|LORD DARLINGTON.|(R.C.)  Oh, don't say that, Lady Windermere.  I should never be admitted!  (Sitting.)
126|10|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Oh, men don't matter.  With women it is different.  We're good.  Some of us are, at least.  But we are positively getting elbowed into the
127|11|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|corner.  Our husbands would really forget our existence if we didn't nag at them from time to time, just to remind them that we have a
128|12|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|perfect legal right to do so.
129|48|LORD DARLINGTON.|It's a curious thing, Duchess, about the game of marriage--a game, by the way, that is going out of fashion--the wives hold all the honours,
130|49|LORD DARLINGTON.|and invariably lose the odd trick.
131|13|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|The odd trick?  Is that the husband, Lord Darlington?
132|50|LORD DARLINGTON.|It would be rather a good name for the modern husband.
133|14|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Dear Lord Darlington, how thoroughly depraved you are!
134|48|LADY WINDERMERE.|Lord Darlington is trivial.
135|51|LORD DARLINGTON.|Ah, don't say that, Lady Windermere.
136|49|LADY WINDERMERE.|Why do you TALK so trivially about life, then?
137|52|LORD DARLINGTON.|Because I think that life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about it.  (Moves up C.)
138|15|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|What does he mean?  Do, as a concession to my poor wits, Lord Darlington, just explain to me what you really mean.
139|53|LORD DARLINGTON.|(Coming down back of table.)  I think I had better not, Duchess.  Nowadays to be intelligible is to be found out.  Good-bye!  (Shakes hands
140|54|LORD DARLINGTON.|with DUCHESS.)  And now--(goes up stage) Lady Windermere, good-bye.  I may come to-night, mayn't I? Do let me come.
141|50|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Standing up stage with LORD DARLINGTON.)  Yes, certainly.  But you are not to say foolish, insincere things to people.
142|55|LORD DARLINGTON.|(Smiling.)  Ah! you are beginning to reform me. It is a dangerous thing to reform any one, Lady Windermere.  (Bows, and exit C.)
143|16|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|(Who has risen, goes C.)  What a charming, wicked creature!  I like him so much.  I'm quite delighted he's gone!  How sweet you're looking! 
144|17|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Where DO you get your gowns?  And now I must tell you how sorry I am for you, dear Margaret. (Crosses to sofa and sits with LADY
145|18|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|WINDERMERE.)  Agatha, darling!
146|1|LADY AGATHA.|Yes, mamma.  (Rises.)
147|19|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Will you go and look over the photograph album that I see there?
148|2|LADY AGATHA.|Yes, mamma.  (Goes to table up L.)
149|20|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Dear girl!  She is so fond of photographs of Switzerland.  Such a pure taste, I think.  But I really am so sorry for you, Margaret
150|51|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Smiling.)  Why, Duchess?
151|21|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Oh, on account of that horrid woman.  She dresses so well, too, which makes it much worse, sets such a dreadful example.  Augustus--you know
152|22|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|my disreputable brother--such a trial to us all--well, Augustus is completely infatuated about her.  It is quite scandalous, for she is
153|23|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|absolutely inadmissible into society.  Many a woman has a past, but I am told that she has at least a dozen, and that they all fit.
154|52|LADY WINDERMERE.|Whom are you talking about, Duchess?
155|24|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|About Mrs. Erlynne.
156|53|LADY WINDERMERE.|Mrs. Erlynne?  I never heard of her, Duchess. And what HAS she to do with me?
157|25|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|My poor child!  Agatha, darling!
158|3|LADY AGATHA.|Yes, mamma.
159|26|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Will you go out on the terrace and look at the sunset?
160|4|LADY AGATHA.|Yes, mamma.  (Exit through window, L.)
161|27|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Sweet girl!  So devoted to sunsets!  Shows such refinement of feeling, does it not?  After all, there is nothing like Nature, is there?
162|54|LADY WINDERMERE.|But what is it, Duchess?  Why do you talk to me about this person?
163|28|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Don't you really know?  I assure you we're all so distressed about it.  Only last night at dear Lady Jansen's every one was saying how
164|29|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|extraordinary it was that, of all men in London, Windermere should behave in such a way.
165|55|LADY WINDERMERE.|My husband--what has HE got to do with any woman of that kind?
166|30|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Ah, what indeed, dear?  That is the point.  He goes to see her continually, and stops for hours at a time, and while he is there she is not
167|31|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|at home to any one.  Not that many ladies call on her, dear, but she has a great many disreputable men friends--my own brother particularly,
168|32|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|as I told you--and that is what makes it so dreadful about Windermere.  We looked upon HIM as being such a model husband, but I am afraid
169|33|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|there is no doubt about it.  My dear nieces--you know the Saville girls, don't you?--such nice domestic creatures--plain, dreadfully plain,
170|34|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|but so good-- well, they're always at the window doing fancy work, and making ugly things for the poor, which I think so useful of them in
171|35|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|these dreadful socialistic days, and this terrible woman has taken a house in Curzon Street, right opposite them--such a respectable street,
172|36|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|too!  I don't know what we're coming to!  And they tell me that Windermere goes there four and five times a week--they SEE him.  They can't
173|37|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|help it--and although they never talk scandal, they--well, of course--they remark on it to every one.  And the worst of it all is that I
174|38|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|have been told that this woman has got a great deal of money out of somebody, for it seems that she came to London six months ago without
175|39|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|anything at all to speak of, and now she has this charming house in Mayfair, drives her ponies in the Park every afternoon and all--well,
176|40|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|all--since she has known poor dear Windermere.
177|56|LADY WINDERMERE.|Oh, I can't believe it!
178|41|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|But it's quite true, my dear.  The whole of London knows it.  That is why I felt it was better to come and talk to you, and advise you to
179|42|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|take Windermere away at once to Homburg or to Aix, where he'll have something to amuse him, and where you can watch him all day long.  I
180|43|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|assure you, my dear, that on several occasions after I was first married, I had to pretend to be very ill, and was obliged to drink the most
181|44|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|unpleasant mineral waters, merely to get Berwick out of town.  He was so extremely susceptible.  Though I am bound to say he never gave away
182|45|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|any large sums of money to anybody.  He is far too high-principled for that!
183|57|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Interrupting.)  Duchess, Duchess, it's impossible!  (Rising and crossing stage to C.)  We are only married two years.  Our child is but six
184|58|LADY WINDERMERE.|months old.  (Sits in chair R. of L. table.)
185|46|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Ah, the dear pretty baby!  How is the little darling?  Is it a boy or a girl?  I hope a girl--Ah, no, I remember it's a boy!  I'm so sorry. 
186|47|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Boys are so wicked.  My boy is excessively immoral.  You wouldn't believe at what hours he comes home.  And he's only left Oxford a few
187|48|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|months--I really don't know what they teach them there.
188|59|LADY WINDERMERE.|Are ALL men bad?
189|49|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Oh, all of them, my dear, all of them, without any exception.  And they never grow any better.  Men become old, but they never become good.
190|60|LADY WINDERMERE.|Windermere and I married for love.
191|50|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Yes, we begin like that.  It was only Berwick's brutal and incessant threats of suicide that made me accept him at all, and before the year
192|51|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|was out, he was running after all kinds of petticoats, every colour, every shape, every material.  In fact, before the honeymoon was over, I
193|52|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|caught him winking at my maid, a most pretty, respectable girl.  I dismissed her at once without a character.--No, I remember I passed her
194|53|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|on to my sister; poor dear Sir George is so short-sighted, I thought it wouldn't matter.  But it did, though--it was most unfortunate.
195|54|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|(Rises.)  And now, my dear child, I must go, as we are dining out. And mind you don't take this little aberration of Windermere's too much
196|55|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|to heart.  Just take him abroad, and he'll come back to you all right.
197|61|LADY WINDERMERE.|Come back to me?  (C.)
198|56|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|(L.C.)  Yes, dear, these wicked women get our husbands away from us, but they always come back, slightly damaged, of course.  And don't make
199|57|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|scenes, men hate them!
200|62|LADY WINDERMERE.|It is very kind of you, Duchess, to come and tell me all this.  But I can't believe that my husband is untrue to me.
201|58|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Pretty child!  I was like that once.  Now I know that all men are monsters.  (LADY WINDERMERE rings bell.)  The only thing to do is to feed
202|59|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|the wretches well.  A good cook does wonders, and that I know you have.  My dear Margaret, you are not going to cry?
203|63|LADY WINDERMERE.|You needn't be afraid, Duchess, I never cry.
204|60|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|That's quite right, dear.  Crying is the refuge of plain women but the ruin of pretty ones.  Agatha, darling!
205|5|LADY AGATHA.|(Entering L.)  Yes, mamma.  (Stands back of table L.C.)
206|61|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Come and bid good-bye to Lady Windermere, and thank her for your charming visit.  (Coming down again.)  And by the way, I must thank you for
207|62|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|sending a card to Mr. Hopper--he's that rich young Australian people are taking such notice of just at present.  His father made a great
208|63|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|fortune by selling some kind of food in circular tins--most palatable, I believe--I fancy it is the thing the servants always refuse to eat.
209|64|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.| But the son is quite interesting.  I think he's attracted by dear Agatha's clever talk. Of course, we should be very sorry to lose her, but
210|65|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|I think that a mother who doesn't part with a daughter every season has no real affection.  We're coming to-night, dear.  (PARKER opens C.
211|66|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|doors.) And remember my advice, take the poor fellow out of town at once, it is the only thing to do.  Good-bye, once more; come, Agatha.
212|0||(Exeunt DUCHESS and LADY AGATHA C.)
213|64|LADY WINDERMERE.|How horrible!  I understand now what Lord Darlington meant by the imaginary instance of the couple not two years married.  Oh! it can't be
214|65|LADY WINDERMERE.|true--she spoke of enormous sums of money paid to this woman.  I know where Arthur keeps his bank book- -in one of the drawers of that desk.
215|66|LADY WINDERMERE.| I might find out by that.  I WILL find out.  (Opens drawer.)  No, it is some hideous mistake. (Rises and goes C.)  Some silly scandal!  He
216|67|LADY WINDERMERE.|loves ME!  He loves ME!  But why should I not look?  I am his wife, I have a right to look!  (Returns to bureau, takes out book and examines
217|68|LADY WINDERMERE.|it page by page, smiles and gives a sigh of relief.)  I knew it! there is not a word of truth in this stupid story.  (Puts book back in
218|69|LADY WINDERMERE.|dranver. As the does so, starts and takes out another book.)  A second book- -private--locked!  (Tries to open it, but fails.  Sees paper
219|70|LADY WINDERMERE.|knife on bureau, and with it cuts cover from book.  Begins to start at the first page.)  'Mrs. Erlynne--600 pounds--Mrs. Erlynne--700
220|71|LADY WINDERMERE.|pounds--Mrs. Erlynne--400 pounds.'  Oh! it is true!  It is true! How horrible!  (Throws book on floor.)  (Enter LORD WINDERMERE C.)
221|1|LORD WINDERMERE.|Well, dear, has the fan been sent home yet? (Going R.C.  Sees book.)  Margaret, you have cut open my bank book. You have no right to do such
222|2|LORD WINDERMERE.|a thing!
223|72|LADY WINDERMERE.|You think it wrong that you are found out, don't you?
224|3|LORD WINDERMERE.|I think it wrong that a wife should spy on her husband.
225|73|LADY WINDERMERE.|I did not spy on you.  I never knew of this woman's existence till half an hour ago.  Some one who pitied me was kind enough to tell me what
226|74|LADY WINDERMERE.|every one in London knows already-- your daily visits to Curzon Street, your mad infatuation, the monstrous sums of money you squander on
227|75|LADY WINDERMERE.|this infamous woman! (Crossing L.)
228|4|LORD WINDERMERE.|Margaret! don't talk like that of Mrs. Erlynne, you don't know how unjust it is!
229|76|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Turning to him.)  You are very jealous of Mrs. Erlynne's honour.  I wish you had been as jealous of mine.
230|5|LORD WINDERMERE.|Your honour is untouched, Margaret.  You don't think for a moment that--(Puts book back into desk.)
231|77|LADY WINDERMERE.|I think that you spend your money strangely. That is all.  Oh, don't imagine I mind about the money.  As far as I am concerned, you may
232|78|LADY WINDERMERE.|squander everything we have.  But what I DO mind is that you who have loved me, you who have taught me to love you, should pass from the
233|79|LADY WINDERMERE.|love that is given to the love that is bought.  Oh, it's horrible!  (Sits on sofa.)  And it is I who feel degraded! YOU don't feel anything.
234|80|LADY WINDERMERE.| I feel stained, utterly stained.  You can't realise how hideous the last six months seems to me now--every kiss you have given me is
235|81|LADY WINDERMERE.|tainted in my memory.
236|6|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Crossing to her.)  Don't say that, Margaret.  I never loved any one in the whole world but you.
237|82|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Rises.)  Who is this woman, then?  Why do you take a house for her?
238|7|LORD WINDERMERE.|I did not take a house for her.
239|83|LADY WINDERMERE.|You gave her the money to do it, which is the same thing.
240|8|LORD WINDERMERE.|Margaret, as far as I have known Mrs. Erlynne -
241|84|LADY WINDERMERE.|Is there a Mr. Erlynne--or is he a myth?
242|9|LORD WINDERMERE.|Her husband died many years ago.  She is alone in the world.
243|85|LADY WINDERMERE.|No relations?  (A pause.)
244|10|LORD WINDERMERE.|None.
245|86|LADY WINDERMERE.|Rather curious, isn't it?  (L.)
246|11|LORD WINDERMERE.|(L.C.)  Margaret, I was saying to you--and I beg you to listen to me--that as far as I have known Mrs. Erlynne, she has conducted herself
247|12|LORD WINDERMERE.|well.  If years ago -
248|87|LADY WINDERMERE.|Oh!  (Crossing R.C.)  I don't want details about her life!
249|13|LORD WINDERMERE.|(C.)  I am not going to give you any details about her life.  I tell you simply this--Mrs. Erlynne was once honoured, loved, respected.  She
250|14|LORD WINDERMERE.|was well born, she had position-- she lost everything--threw it away, if you like.  That makes it all the more bitter.  Misfortunes one can
251|15|LORD WINDERMERE.|endure--they come from outside, they are accidents.  But to suffer for one's own faults-- ah!--there is the sting of life.  It was twenty
252|16|LORD WINDERMERE.|years ago, too. She was little more than a girl then.  She had been a wife for even less time than you have.
253|88|LADY WINDERMERE.|I am not interested in her--and--you should not mention this woman and me in the same breath.  It is an error of taste.  (Sitting R. at
254|89|LADY WINDERMERE.|desk.)
255|17|LORD WINDERMERE.|Margaret, you could save this woman.  She wants to get back into society, and she wants you to help her.  (Crossing to her.)
256|90|LADY WINDERMERE.|Me!
257|18|LORD WINDERMERE.|Yes, you.
258|91|LADY WINDERMERE.|How impertinent of her!  (A pause.)
259|19|LORD WINDERMERE.|Margaret, I came to ask you a great favour, and I still ask it of you, though you have discovered what I had intended you should never have
260|20|LORD WINDERMERE.|known that I have given Mrs. Erlynne a large sum of money.  I want you to send her an invitation for our party to-night.  (Standing L. of
261|21|LORD WINDERMERE.|her.)
262|92|LADY WINDERMERE.|You are mad!  (Rises.)
263|22|LORD WINDERMERE.|I entreat you.  People may chatter about her, do chatter about her, of course, but they don't know anything definite against her.  She has
264|23|LORD WINDERMERE.|been to several houses--not to houses where you would go, I admit, but still to houses where women who are in what is called Society
265|24|LORD WINDERMERE.|nowadays do go.  That does not content her. She wants you to receive her once.
266|93|LADY WINDERMERE.|As a triumph for her, I suppose?
267|25|LORD WINDERMERE.|No; but because she knows that you are a good woman--and that if she comes here once she will have a chance of a happier, a surer life than
268|26|LORD WINDERMERE.|she has had.  She will make no further effort to know you.  Won't you help a woman who is trying to get back?
269|94|LADY WINDERMERE.|No!  If a woman really repents, she never wishes to return to the society that has made or seen her ruin.
270|27|LORD WINDERMERE.|I beg of you.
271|95|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Crossing to door R.)  I am going to dress for dinner, and don't mention the subject again this evening.  Arthur (going to him C.), you
272|96|LADY WINDERMERE.|fancy because I have no father or mother that I am alone in the world, and that you can treat me as you choose.  You are wrong, I have
273|97|LADY WINDERMERE.|friends, many friends.
274|28|LORD WINDERMERE.|(L.C.)  Margaret, you are talking foolishly, recklessly.  I won't argue with you, but I insist upon your asking Mrs. Erlynne to-night.
275|98|LADY WINDERMERE.|(R.C.)  I shall do nothing of the kind. (Crossing L. C.)
276|29|LORD WINDERMERE.|You refuse?  (C.)
277|99|LADY WINDERMERE.|Absolutely!
278|30|LORD WINDERMERE.|Ah, Margaret, do this for my sake; it is her last chance.
279|100|LADY WINDERMERE.|What has that to do with me?
280|31|LORD WINDERMERE.|How hard good women are!
281|101|LADY WINDERMERE.|How weak bad men are!
282|32|LORD WINDERMERE.|Margaret, none of us men may be good enough for the women we marry--that is quite true--but you don't imagine I would ever--oh, the
283|33|LORD WINDERMERE.|suggestion is monstrous!
284|102|LADY WINDERMERE.|Why should YOU be different from other men?  I am told that there is hardly a husband in London who does not waste his life over SOME
285|103|LADY WINDERMERE.|shameful passion.
286|34|LORD WINDERMERE.|I am not one of them.
287|104|LADY WINDERMERE.|I am not sure of that!
288|35|LORD WINDERMERE.|You are sure in your heart.  But don't make chasm after chasm between us.  God knows the last few minutes have thrust us wide enough apart. 
289|36|LORD WINDERMERE.|Sit down and write the card.
290|105|LADY WINDERMERE.|Nothing in the whole world would induce me.
291|37|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Crossing to bureau.)  Then I will!  (Rings electric bell, sits and writes card.)
292|106|LADY WINDERMERE.|You are going to invite this woman?  (Crossing to him.)
293|38|LORD WINDERMERE.|Yes.  (Pause.  Enter PARKER.)  Parker!
294|7|PARKER.|Yes, my lord.  (Comes down L.C.)
295|39|LORD WINDERMERE.|Have this note sent to Mrs. Erlynne at No. 84A Curzon Street.  (Crossing to L.C. and giving note to PARKER.) There is no answer!
296|0||(Exit PARKER C.)
297|107|LADY WINDERMERE.|Arthur, if that woman comes here, I shall insult her.
298|40|LORD WINDERMERE.|Margaret, don't say that.
299|108|LADY WINDERMERE.|I mean it.
300|41|LORD WINDERMERE.|Child, if you did such a thing, there's not a woman in London who wouldn't pity you.
301|109|LADY WINDERMERE.|There is not a GOOD woman in London who would not applaud me.  We have been too lax.  We must make an example.  I propose to begin to-night.
302|110|LADY WINDERMERE.| (Picking up fan.)  Yes, you gave me this fan to-day; it was your birthday present.  If that woman crosses my threshold, I shall strike her
303|111|LADY WINDERMERE.|across the face with it.
304|42|LORD WINDERMERE.|Margaret, you couldn't do such a thing.
305|112|LADY WINDERMERE.|You don't know me!  (Moves R.)
306|0||(Enter PARKER.)
307|0||Parker!
308|8|PARKER.|Yes, my lady.
309|113|LADY WINDERMERE.|I shall dine in my own room.  I don't want dinner, in fact.  See that everything is ready by half-past ten. And, Parker, be sure you
310|114|LADY WINDERMERE.|pronounce the names of the guests very distinctly to-night.  Sometimes you speak so fast that I miss them. I am particularly anxious to hear
311|115|LADY WINDERMERE.|the names quite clearly, so as to make no mistake.  You understand, Parker?
312|9|PARKER.|Yes, my lady.
313|116|LADY WINDERMERE.|That will do!
314|0||(Exit PARKER C.)
315|0||(Speaking to LORD WINDERMERE)  Arthur, if that woman comes here--I warn you -
316|43|LORD WINDERMERE.|Margaret, you'll ruin us!
317|117|LADY WINDERMERE.|Us!  From this moment my life is separate from yours.  But if you wish to avoid a public scandal, write at once to this woman, and tell her
318|118|LADY WINDERMERE.|that I forbid her to come here!
319|44|LORD WINDERMERE.|I will not--I cannot--she must come!
320|119|LADY WINDERMERE.|Then I shall do exactly as I have said.  (Goes R.)  You leave me no choice.  (Exit R.)
321|45|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Calling after her.)  Margaret!  Margaret!  (A pause.)  My God!  What shall I do?  I dare not tell her who this woman really is.  The shame
322|46|LORD WINDERMERE.|would kill her.  (Sinks down into a chair and buries his face in his hands.)
323|0||SECOND ACT
324|0||Drawing-room in Lord Windermere's house.  Door R.U. opening into ball-room, where band is playing.  Door L. through which guests are
325|0||entering.  Door L.U. opens on to illuminated terrace.  Palms, flowers, and brilliant lights.  Room crowded with guests.  Lady Windermere is
326|0||receiving them.
327|67|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|(Up C.)  So strange Lord Windermere isn't here.  Mr. Hopper is very late, too.  You have kept those five dances for him, Agatha?  (Comes
328|68|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|down.)
329|6|LADY AGATHA.|Yes, mamma.
330|69|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|(Sitting on sofa.)  Just let me see your card. I'm so glad Lady Windermere has revived cards.--They're a mother's only safeguard.  You dear
331|70|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|simple little thing!  (Scratches out two names.)  No nice girl should ever waltz with such particularly younger sons!  It looks so fast! 
332|71|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|The last two dances you might pass on the terrace with Mr. Hopper.
333|0||(Enter MR. DUMBY and LADY PLYMDALE from the ball-room.)
334|7|LADY AGATHA.|Yes, mamma.
335|72|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|(Fanning herself.)  The air is so pleasant there.
336|10|PARKER.|Mrs. Cowper-Cowper.  Lady Stutfield.  Sir James Royston. Mr. Guy Berkeley.
337|0||(These people enter as announced.)
338|1|DUMBY.|Good evening, Lady Stutfield.  I suppose this will be the last ball of the season?
339|1|LADY STUTFIELD.|I suppose so, Mr. Dumby.  It's been a delightful season, hasn't it?
340|2|DUMBY.|Quite delightful!  Good evening, Duchess.  I suppose this will be the last ball of the season?
341|73|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|I suppose so, Mr. Dumby.  It has been a very dull season, hasn't it?
342|3|DUMBY.|Dreadfully dull!  Dreadfully dull!
343|0||MR. COWPER-COWPER.  Good evening, Mr. Dumby.  I suppose this will be the last ball of the season?
344|4|DUMBY.|Oh, I think not.  There'll probably be two more.  (Wanders back to LADY PLYMDALE.)
345|11|PARKER.|Mr. Rufford.  Lady Jedburgh and Miss Graham.  Mr. Hopper.
346|0||(These people enter as announced.)
347|1|HOPPER.|How do you do, Lady Windermere?  How do you do, Duchess? (Bows to LADY AGATHA.)
348|74|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Dear Mr. Hopper, how nice of you to come so early.  We all know how you are run after in London.
349|2|HOPPER.|Capital place, London!  They are not nearly so exclusive in London as they are in Sydney.
350|75|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Ah! we know your value, Mr. Hopper.  We wish there were more like you.  It would make life so much easier.  Do you know, Mr. Hopper, dear
351|76|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Agatha and I are so much interested in Australia.  It must be so pretty with all the dear little kangaroos flying about.  Agatha has found
352|77|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|it on the map.  What a curious shape it is!  Just like a large packing case.  However, it is a very young country, isn't it?
353|3|HOPPER.|Wasn't it made at the same time as the others, Duchess?
354|78|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|How clever you are, Mr. Hopper.  You have a cleverness quite of your own.  Now I mustn't keep you.
355|4|HOPPER.|But I should like to dance with Lady Agatha, Duchess.
356|79|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Well, I hope she has a dance left.  Have you a dance left, Agatha?
357|8|LADY AGATHA.|Yes, mamma.
358|80|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|The next one?
359|9|LADY AGATHA.|Yes, mamma.
360|5|HOPPER.|May I have the pleasure?  (LADY AGATHA bows.)
361|81|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Mind you take great care of my little chatterbox, Mr. Hopper.
362|0||(LADY AGATHA and MR. HOPPER pass into ball-room.)
363|0||(Enter LORD WINDERMERE.)
364|47|LORD WINDERMERE.|Margaret, I want to speak to you.
365|120|LADY WINDERMERE.|In a moment.  (The music drops.)
366|12|PARKER.|Lord Augustus Lorton.
367|0||(Enter LORD AUGUSTUS.)
368|1|LORD AUGUSTUS.|Good evening, Lady Windermere.
369|82|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Sir James, will you take me into the ball- room?  Augustus has been dining with us to-night.  I really have had quite enough of dear
370|83|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Augustus for the moment.
371|0||(SIR JAMES ROYSTON gives the DUCHESS his aim and escorts her into the ball-room.)
372|13|PARKER.|Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Bowden.  Lord and Lady Paisley.  Lord Darlington.
373|0||(These people enter as announced.)
374|2|LORD AUGUSTUS.|(Coming up to LORD WINDERMERE.)  Want to speak to you particularly, dear boy.  I'm worn to a shadow.  Know I don't look it.  None of us men
375|3|LORD AUGUSTUS.|do look what we really are.  Demmed good thing, too.  What I want to know is this.  Who is she?  Where does she come from?  Why hasn't she
376|4|LORD AUGUSTUS.|got any demmed relations?  Demmed nuisance, relations!  But they make one so demmed respectable.
377|48|LORD WINDERMERE.|You are talking of Mrs. Erlynne, I suppose?  I only met her six months ago.  Till then, I never knew of her existence.
378|5|LORD AUGUSTUS.|You have seen a good deal of her since then.
379|49|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Coldly.)  Yes, I have seen a good deal of her since then.  I have just seen her.
380|6|LORD AUGUSTUS.|Egad! the women are very down on her.  I have been dining with Arabella this evening!  By Jove! you should have heard what she said about
381|7|LORD AUGUSTUS.|Mrs. Erlynne.  She didn't leave a rag on her. . . (Aside.)  Berwick and I told her that didn't matter much, as the lady in question must
382|8|LORD AUGUSTUS.|have an extremely fine figure.  You should have seen Arabella's expression! . . . But, look here, dear boy.  I don't know what to do about
383|9|LORD AUGUSTUS.|Mrs. Erlynne.  Egad!  I might be married to her; she treats me with such demmed indifference. She's deuced clever, too!  She explains
384|10|LORD AUGUSTUS.|everything.  Egad! she explains you.  She has got any amount of explanations for you--and all of them different.
385|50|LORD WINDERMERE.|No explanations are necessary about my friendship with Mrs. Erlynne.
386|11|LORD AUGUSTUS.|Hem!  Well, look here, dear old fellow.  Do you think she will ever get into this demmed thing called Society? Would you introduce her to
387|12|LORD AUGUSTUS.|your wife?  No use beating about the confounded bush.  Would you do that?
388|51|LORD WINDERMERE.|Mrs. Erlynne is coming here to-night.
389|13|LORD AUGUSTUS.|Your wife has sent her a card?
390|52|LORD WINDERMERE.|Mrs. Erlynne has received a card.
391|14|LORD AUGUSTUS.|Then she's all right, dear boy.  But why didn't you tell me that before?  It would have saved me a heap of worry and demmed
392|15|LORD AUGUSTUS.|misunderstandings!
393|0||(LADY AGATHA and MR. HOPPER cross and exit on terrace L.U.E.)
394|14|PARKER.|Mr. Cecil Graham!
395|0||(Enter MR. CECIL GRAHAM.)
396|1|CECIL GRAHAM.|(Bows to LADY WINDERMERE, passes over and shakes hands with LORD WINDERMERE.)  Good evening, Arthur.  Why don't you ask me how I am?  I like
397|2|CECIL GRAHAM.|people to ask me how I am.  It shows a wide-spread interest in my health.  Now, to-night I am not at all well.  Been dining with my people. 
398|3|CECIL GRAHAM.|Wonder why it is one's people are always so tedious?  My father would talk morality after dinner. I told him he was old enough to know
399|4|CECIL GRAHAM.|better.  But my experience is that as soon as people are old enough to know better, they don't know anything at all.  Hallo, Tuppy!  Hear
400|5|CECIL GRAHAM.|you're going to be married again; thought you were tired of that game.
401|16|LORD AUGUSTUS.|You're excessively trivial, my dear boy, excessively trivial!
402|6|CECIL GRAHAM.|By the way, Tuppy, which is it?  Have you been twice married and once divorced, or twice divorced and once married?  I say you've been twice
403|7|CECIL GRAHAM.|divorced and once married.  It seems so much more probable.
404|17|LORD AUGUSTUS.|I have a very bad memory.  I really don't remember which.  (Moves away R.)
405|1|LADY PLYMDALE.|Lord Windermere, I've something most particular to ask you.
406|53|LORD WINDERMERE.|I am afraid--if you will excuse me--I must join my wife.
407|2|LADY PLYMDALE.|Oh, you mustn't dream of such a thing.  It's most dangerous nowadays for a husband to pay any attention to his wife in public.  It always
408|3|LADY PLYMDALE.|makes people think that he beats her when they're alone.  The world has grown so suspicious of anything that looks like a happy married
409|4|LADY PLYMDALE.|life.  But I'll tell you what it is at supper.  (Moves towards door of ball-room.)
410|54|LORD WINDERMERE.|(C.)  Margaret!  I MUST speak to you.
411|121|LADY WINDERMERE.|Will you hold my fan for me, Lord Darlington? Thanks.  (Comes down to him.)
412|55|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Crossing to her.)  Margaret, what you said before dinner was, of course, impossible?
413|122|LADY WINDERMERE.|That woman is not coming here to-night!
414|56|LORD WINDERMERE.|(R.C.)  Mrs. Erlynne is coming here, and if you in any way annoy or wound her, you will bring shame and sorrow on us both.  Remember that! 
415|57|LORD WINDERMERE.|Ah, Margaret! only trust me!  A wife should trust her husband!
416|123|LADY WINDERMERE.|(C.)  London is full of women who trust their husbands.  One can always recognise them.  They look so thoroughly unhappy.  I am not going to
417|124|LADY WINDERMERE.|be one of them.  (Moves up.)  Lord Darlington, will you give me back my fan, please?  Thanks. . . . A useful thing a fan, isn't it? . . . I
418|125|LADY WINDERMERE.|want a friend to-night, Lord Darlington:  I didn't know I would want one so soon.
419|56|LORD DARLINGTON.|Lady Windermere!  I knew the time would come some day; but why to-night?
420|58|LORD WINDERMERE.|I WILL tell her.  I must.  It would be terrible if there were any scene.  Margaret . . .
421|15|PARKER.|Mrs. Erlynne!
422|0||(LORD WINDERMERE starts.  MRS. ERLYNNE enters, very beautifully dressed and very dignified.  LADY WINDERMERE clutches at her fan, then lets
423|0||it drop on the door.  She bows coldly to MRS. ERLYNNE, who bows to her sweetly in turn, and sails into the room.)
424|57|LORD DARLINGTON.|You have dropped your fan, Lady Windermere. (Picks it up and hands it to her.)
425|1|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(C.)  How do you do, again, Lord Windermere?  How charming your sweet wife looks!  Quite a picture!
426|59|LORD WINDERMERE.|(In a low voice.)  It was terribly rash of you to come!
427|2|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Smiling.)  The wisest thing I ever did in my life. And, by the way, you must pay me a good deal of attention this evening.  I am afraid of
428|3|MRS. ERLYNNE.|the women.  You must introduce me to some of them.  The men I can always manage.  How do you do, Lord Augustus?  You have quite neglected me
429|4|MRS. ERLYNNE.|lately.  I have not seen you since yesterday.  I am afraid you're faithless.  Every one told me so.
430|18|LORD AUGUSTUS.|(R.)  Now really, Mrs. Erlynne, allow me to explain.
431|5|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(R.C.)  No, dear Lord Augustus, you can't explain anything.  It is your chief charm.
432|19|LORD AUGUSTUS.|Ah! if you find charms in me, Mrs. Erlynne -
433|0||(They converse together.  LORD WINDERMERE moves uneasily about the room watching MRS. ERLYNNE.)
434|58|LORD DARLINGTON.|(To LADY WINDERMERE.)  How pale you are!
435|126|LADY WINDERMERE.|Cowards are always pale!
436|59|LORD DARLINGTON.|You look faint.  Come out on the terrace.
437|127|LADY WINDERMERE.|Yes.  (To PARKER.)  Parker, send my cloak out.
438|6|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Crossing to her.)  Lady Windermere, how beautifully your terrace is illuminated.  Reminds me of Prince Doria's at Rome.
439|0||(LADY WINDERMERE bows coldly, and goes off with LORD DARLINGTON.)
440|0||Oh, how do you do, Mr. Graham?  Isn't that your aunt, Lady Jedburgh?  I should so much like to know her.
441|8|CECIL GRAHAM.|(After a moment's hesitation and embarrassment.) Oh, certainly, if you wish it.  Aunt Caroline, allow me to introduce Mrs. Erlynne.
442|7|MRS. ERLYNNE.|So pleased to meet you, Lady Jedburgh.  (Sits beside her on the sofa.)  Your nephew and I are great friends.  I am so much interested in his
443|8|MRS. ERLYNNE.|political career.  I think he's sure to be a wonderful success.  He thinks like a Tory, and talks like a Radical, and that's so important
444|9|MRS. ERLYNNE.|nowadays.  He's such a brilliant talker, too.  But we all know from whom he inherits that.  Lord Allandale was saying to me only yesterday,
445|10|MRS. ERLYNNE.|in the Park, that Mr. Graham talks almost as well as his aunt.
446|1|LADY JEDBURGH.|(R.)  Most kind of you to say these charming things to me!  (MRS.  ERLYNNE smiles, and continues conversation.)
447|5|DUMBY.|(To CECIL GRAHAM.)  Did you introduce Mrs. Erlynne to Lady Jedburgh?
448|9|CECIL GRAHAM.|Had to, my dear fellow.  Couldn't help it!  That woman can make one do anything she wants.  How, I don't know.
449|6|DUMBY.|Hope to goodness she won't speak to me!  (Saunters towards LADY PLYMDALE.)
450|11|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(C.  To LADY JEDBURGH.)  On Thursday?  With great pleasure.  (Rises, and speaks to LORD WINDERMERE, laughing.)  What a bore it is to have to
451|12|MRS. ERLYNNE.|be civil to these old dowagers!  But they always insist on it!
452|5|LADY PLYMDALE.|(To MR. DUMBY.)  Who is that well-dressed woman talking to Windermere?
453|7|DUMBY.|Haven't got the slightest idea!  Looks like an edition de luxe of a wicked French novel, meant specially for the English market.
454|13|MRS. ERLYNNE.|So that is poor Dumby with Lady Plymdale?  I hear she is frightfully jealous of him.  He doesn't seem anxious to speak to me to-night.  I
455|14|MRS. ERLYNNE.|suppose he is afraid of her.  Those straw- coloured women have dreadful tempers.  Do you know, I think I'll dance with you first,
456|15|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Windermere.  (LORD WINDERMERE bits his lip and frowns.)  It will make Lord Augustus so jealous!  Lord Augustus!  (LORD AUGUSTUS comes down.)
457|16|MRS. ERLYNNE.| Lord Windermere insists on my dancing with him first, and, as it's his own house, I can't well refuse.  You know I would much sooner dance
458|17|MRS. ERLYNNE.|with you.
459|20|LORD AUGUSTUS.|(With a low bow.)  I wish I could think so, Mrs. Erlynne.
460|1|MRS ERLYNNE.|You know it far too well.  I can fancy a person dancing through life with you and finding it charming.
461|21|LORD AUGUSTUS.|(Placing his hand on his white waistcoat.)  Oh, thank you, thank you.  You are the most adorable of all ladies!
462|18|MRS. ERLYNNE.|What a nice speech!  So simple and so sincere!  Just the sort of speech I like.  Well, you shall hold my bouquet.  (Goes towards ball-room
463|19|MRS. ERLYNNE.|on LORD WINDERMERE'S arm.)  Ah, Mr. Dumby, how are you?  I am so sorry I have been out the last three times you have called.  Come and lunch
464|20|MRS. ERLYNNE.|on Friday.
465|8|DUMBY.|(With perfect nonchalance.)  Delighted!
466|0||(LADY PLYMDALE glares with indignation at MR. DUMBY.  LORD AUGUSTUS follows MRS. ERLYNNE and LORD WINDERMERE into the ball-room holding
467|0||bouquet)
468|6|LADY PLYMDALE.|(To MR. DUMBY.)  What an absolute brute you are!  I never can believe a word you say!  Why did you tell me you didn't know her?  What do you
469|7|LADY PLYMDALE.|mean by calling on her three times running? You are not to go to lunch there; of course you understand that?
470|9|DUMBY.|My dear Laura, I wouldn't dream of going!
471|8|LADY PLYMDALE.|You haven't told me her name yet!  Who is she?
472|10|DUMBY.|(Coughs slightly and smooths his hair.)  She's a Mrs. Erlynne.
473|9|LADY PLYMDALE.|That woman!
474|11|DUMBY.|Yes; that is what every one calls her.
475|10|LADY PLYMDALE.|How very interesting!  How intensely interesting! I really must have a good stare at her.  (Goes to door of ball-room and looks in.)  I have
476|11|LADY PLYMDALE.|heard the most shocking things about her. They say she is ruining poor Windermere.  And Lady Windermere, who goes in for being so proper,
477|12|LADY PLYMDALE.|invites her!  How extremely amusing! It takes a thoroughly good woman to do a thoroughly stupid thing. You are to lunch there on Friday!
478|12|DUMBY.|Why?
479|13|LADY PLYMDALE.|Because I want you to take my husband with you.  He has been so attentive lately, that he has become a perfect nuisance.  Now, this woman is
480|14|LADY PLYMDALE.|just the thing for him.  He'll dance attendance upon her as long as she lets him, and won't bother me. I assure you, women of that kind are
481|15|LADY PLYMDALE.|most useful.  They form the basis of other people's marriages.
482|13|DUMBY.|What a mystery you are!
483|16|LADY PLYMDALE.|(Looking at him.)  I wish YOU were!
484|14|DUMBY.|I am--to myself.  I am the only person in the world I should like to know thoroughly; but I don't see any chance of it just at present.
485|0||(They pass into the ball-room, and LADY WINDERMERE and LORD DARLINGTON enter from the terrace.)
486|128|LADY WINDERMERE.|Yes.  Her coming here is monstrous, unbearable. I know now what you meant to-day at tea-time.  Why didn't you tell me right out?  You should
487|129|LADY WINDERMERE.|have!
488|60|LORD DARLINGTON.|I couldn't!  A man can't tell these things about another man!  But if I had known he was going to make you ask her here to-night, I think I
489|61|LORD DARLINGTON.|would have told you.  That insult, at any rate, you would have been spared.
490|130|LADY WINDERMERE.|I did not ask her.  He insisted on her coming-- against my entreaties--against my commands.  Oh! the house is tainted for me!  I feel that
491|131|LADY WINDERMERE.|every woman here sneers at me as she dances by with my husband.  What have I done to deserve this?  I gave him all my life.  He took
492|132|LADY WINDERMERE.|it--used it--spoiled it!  I am degraded in my own eyes; and I lack courage--I am a coward!  (Sits down on sofa.)
493|62|LORD DARLINGTON.|If I know you at all, I know that you can't live with a man who treats you like this!  What sort of life would you have with him?  You would
494|63|LORD DARLINGTON.|feel that he was lying to you every moment of the day.  You would feel that the look in his eyes was false, his voice false, his touch
495|64|LORD DARLINGTON.|false, his passion false.  He would come to you when he was weary of others; you would have to comfort him.  He would come to you when he
496|65|LORD DARLINGTON.|was devoted to others; you would have to charm him.  You would have to be to him the mask of his real life, the cloak to hide his secret.
497|133|LADY WINDERMERE.|You are right--you are terribly right.  But where am I to turn?  You said you would be my friend, Lord Darlington.-- Tell me, what am I to
498|134|LADY WINDERMERE.|do?  Be my friend now.
499|66|LORD DARLINGTON.|Between men and women there is no friendship possible.  There is passion, enmity, worship, love, but no friendship.  I love you -
500|135|LADY WINDERMERE.|No, no!  (Rises.)
501|67|LORD DARLINGTON.|Yes, I love you!  You are more to me than anything in the whole world.  What does your husband give you? Nothing.  Whatever is in him he
502|68|LORD DARLINGTON.|gives to this wretched woman, whom he has thrust into your society, into your home, to shame you before every one.  I offer you my life -
503|136|LADY WINDERMERE.|Lord Darlington!
504|69|LORD DARLINGTON.|My life--my whole life.  Take it, and do with it what you will. . . . I love you--love you as I have never loved any living thing.  From the
505|70|LORD DARLINGTON.|moment I met you I loved you, loved you blindly, adoringly, madly!  You did not know it then--you know it now!  Leave this house to-night. 
506|71|LORD DARLINGTON.|I won't tell you that the world matters nothing, or the world's voice, or the voice of society. They matter a great deal.  They matter far
507|72|LORD DARLINGTON.|too much.  But there are moments when one has to choose between living one's own life, fully, entirely, completely--or dragging out some
508|73|LORD DARLINGTON.|false, shallow, degrading existence that the world in its hypocrisy demands.  You have that moment now.  Choose!  Oh, my love, choose.
509|137|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Moving slowly away from him, and looking at him with startled eyes.)  I have not the courage.
510|74|LORD DARLINGTON.|(Following her.)  Yes; you have the courage. There may be six months of pain, of disgrace even, but when you no longer bear his name, when
511|75|LORD DARLINGTON.|you bear mine, all will be well. Margaret, my love, my wife that shall be some day--yes, my wife! You know it!  What are you now?  This
512|76|LORD DARLINGTON.|woman has the place that belongs by right to you.  Oh! go--go out of this house, with head erect, with a smile upon your lips, with courage
513|77|LORD DARLINGTON.|in your eyes.  All London will know why you did it; and who will blame you?  No one. If they do, what matter?  Wrong?  What is wrong?  It's
514|78|LORD DARLINGTON.|wrong for a man to abandon his wife for a shameless woman.  It is wrong for a wife to remain with a man who so dishonours her.  You said
515|79|LORD DARLINGTON.|once you would make no compromise with things.  Make none now.  Be brave! Be yourself!
516|138|LADY WINDERMERE.|I am afraid of being myself.  Let me think!  Let me wait!  My husband may return to me.  (Sits down on sofa.)
517|80|LORD DARLINGTON.|And you would take him back!  You are not what I thought you were.  You are just the same as every other woman.  You would stand anything
518|81|LORD DARLINGTON.|rather than face the censure of a world, whose praise you would despise.  In a week you will be driving with this woman in the Park.  She
519|82|LORD DARLINGTON.|will be your constant guest--your dearest friend.  You would endure anything rather than break with one blow this monstrous tie.  You are
520|83|LORD DARLINGTON.|right.  You have no courage; none!
521|139|LADY WINDERMERE.|Ah, give me time to think.  I cannot answer you now.  (Passes her hand nervously over her brow.)
522|84|LORD DARLINGTON.|It must be now or not at all.
523|140|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Rising from the sofa.)  Then, not at all!  (A pause.)
524|85|LORD DARLINGTON.|You break my heart!
525|141|LADY WINDERMERE.|Mine is already broken.  (A pause.)
526|86|LORD DARLINGTON.|To-morrow I leave England.  This is the last time I shall ever look on you.  You will never see me again.  For one moment our lives met--our
527|87|LORD DARLINGTON.|souls touched.  They must never meet or touch again.  Good-bye, Margaret.  (Exit.)
528|142|LADY WINDERMERE.|How alone I am in life!  How terribly alone!
529|0||(The music stops.  Enter the DUCHESS OF BERWICK and LORD PAISLEY laughing and talking.  Other guests come on from ball-room.)
530|84|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Dear Margaret, I've just been having such a delightful chat with Mrs. Erlynne.  I am so sorry for what I said to you this afternoon about
531|85|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|her.  Of course, she must be all right if YOU invite her.  A most attractive woman, and has such sensible views on life.  Told me she
532|86|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|entirely disapproved of people marrying more than once, so I feel quite safe about poor Augustus.  Can't imagine why people speak against
533|87|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|her.  It's those horrid nieces of mine--the Saville girls--they're always talking scandal.  Still, I should go to Homburg, dear, I really
534|88|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|should.  She is just a little too attractive.  But where is Agatha?  Oh, there she is:   (LADY AGATHA and MR. HOPPER enter from terrace
535|89|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|L.U.E.)  Mr. Hopper, I am very, very angry with you.  You have taken Agatha out on the terrace, and she is so delicate.
536|6|HOPPER.|Awfully sorry, Duchess.  We went out for a moment and then got chatting together.
537|90|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|(C.)  Ah, about dear Australia, I suppose?
538|7|HOPPER.|Yes!
539|91|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Agatha, darling!  (Beckons her over.)
540|10|LADY AGATHA.|Yes, mamma!
541|92|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|(Aside.)  Did Mr. Hopper definitely -
542|11|LADY AGATHA.|Yes, mamma.
543|93|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|And what answer did you give him, dear child?
544|12|LADY AGATHA.|Yes, mamma.
545|94|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|(Affectionately.)  My dear one!  You always say the right thing.  Mr. Hopper!  James!  Agatha has told me everything.  How cleverly you have
546|95|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|both kept your secret.
547|8|HOPPER.|You don't mind my taking Agatha off to Australia, then, Duchess?
548|96|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|(Indignantly.)  To Australia?  Oh, don't mention that dreadful vulgar place.
549|9|HOPPER.|But she said she'd like to come with me.
550|97|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|(Severely.)  Did you say that, Agatha?
551|13|LADY AGATHA.|Yes, mamma.
552|98|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|Agatha, you say the most silly things possible.  I think on the whole that Grosvenor Square would be a more healthy place to reside in. 
553|99|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|There are lots of vulgar people live in Grosvenor Square, but at any rate there are no horrid kangaroos crawling about.  But we'll talk
554|100|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|about that to-morrow. James, you can take Agatha down.  You'll come to lunch, of course, James.  At half-past one, instead of two.  The Duke
555|101|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|will wish to say a few words to you, I am sure.
556|10|HOPPER.|I should like to have a chat with the Duke, Duchess.  He has not said a single word to me yet.
557|102|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|I think you'll find he will have a great deal to say to you to-morrow.  (Exit LADY AGATHA with MR. HOPPER.)  And now good-night, Margaret. 
558|103|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|I'm afraid it's the old, old story, dear.  Love--well, not love at first sight, but love at the end of the season, which is so much more
559|104|DUCHESS OF BERWICK.|satisfactory.
560|143|LADY WINDERMERE.|Good-night, Duchess.
561|0||(Exit the DUCHESS OF BERWICK on LORD PAISLEY'S arm.)
562|17|LADY PLYMDALE.|My dear Margaret, what a handsome woman your husband has been dancing with!  I should be quite jealous if I were you!  Is she a great friend
563|18|LADY PLYMDALE.|of yours?
564|144|LADY WINDERMERE.|No!
565|19|LADY PLYMDALE.|Really?  Good-night, dear.  (Looks at MR. DUMBY and exit.)
566|15|DUMBY.|Awful manners young Hopper has!
567|10|CECIL GRAHAM.|Ah!  Hopper is one of Nature's gentlemen, the worst type of gentleman I know.
568|16|DUMBY.|Sensible woman, Lady Windermere.  Lots of wives would have objected to Mrs. Erlynne coming.  But Lady Windermere has that uncommon thing
569|17|DUMBY.|called common sense.
570|11|CECIL GRAHAM.|And Windermere knows that nothing looks so like innocence as an indiscretion.
571|18|DUMBY.|Yes; dear Windermere is becoming almost modern.  Never thought he would.  (Bows to LADY WINDERMERE and exit.)
572|2|LADY JEDBURGH.|Good night, Lady Windermere.  What a fascinating woman Mrs. Erlynne is!  She is coming to lunch on Thursday, won't you come too?  I expect
573|3|LADY JEDBURGH.|the Bishop and dear Lady Merton.
574|145|LADY WINDERMERE.|I am afraid I am engaged, Lady Jedburgh.
575|4|LADY JEDBURGH.|So sorry.  Come, dear.  (Exeunt LADY JEDBURGH and MISS GRAHAM.)
576|0||(Enter MRS. ERLYNNE and LORD WINDERMERE.)
577|21|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Charming ball it has been!  Quite reminds me of old days.  (Sits on sofa.)  And I see that there are just as many fools in society as there
578|22|MRS. ERLYNNE.|used to be.  So pleased to find that nothing has altered!  Except Margaret.  She's grown quite pretty.  The last time I saw her--twenty
579|23|MRS. ERLYNNE.|years ago, she was a fright in flannel. Positive fright, I assure you.  The dear Duchess! and that sweet Lady Agatha!  Just the type of girl
580|24|MRS. ERLYNNE.|I like!  Well, really, Windermere, if I am to be the Duchess's sister-in-law
581|60|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Sitting L. of her.)  But are you--?
582|0||(Exit MR. CECIL GRAHAM with rest of guests.  LADY WINDERMERE watches, with a look of scorn and pain, MRS. ERLYNNE and her husband.  They are
583|0||unconscious of her presence.)
584|25|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Oh, yes!  He's to call to-morrow at twelve o'clock! He wanted to propose to-night.  In fact he did.  He kept on proposing.  Poor Augustus,
585|26|MRS. ERLYNNE.|you know how he repeats himself.  Such a bad habit!  But I told him I wouldn't give him an answer till to- morrow.  Of course I am going to
586|27|MRS. ERLYNNE.|take him.  And I dare say I'll make him an admirable wife, as wives go.  And there is a great deal of good in Lord Augustus.  Fortunately it
587|28|MRS. ERLYNNE.|is all on the surface. Just where good qualities should be.  Of course you must help me in this matter.
588|61|LORD WINDERMERE.|I am not called on to encourage Lord Augustus, I suppose?
589|29|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Oh, no!  I do the encouraging.  But you will make me a handsome settlement, Windermere, won't you?
590|62|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Frowning.)  Is that what you want to talk to me about to-night?
591|2|MRS ERLYNNE.|Yes.
592|63|LORD WINDERMERE.|(With a gesture of impatience.)  I will not talk of it here.
593|30|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Laughing.)  Then we will talk of it on the terrace. Even business should have a picturesque background.  Should it not, Windermere?  With a
594|31|MRS. ERLYNNE.|proper background women can do anything.
595|64|LORD WINDERMERE.|Won't to-morrow do as well?
596|32|MRS. ERLYNNE.|No; you see, to-morrow I am going to accept him. And I think it would be a good thing if I was able to tell him that I had--well, what shall
597|33|MRS. ERLYNNE.|I say?--2000 pounds a year left to me by a third cousin--or a second husband--or some distant relative of that kind.  It would be an
598|34|MRS. ERLYNNE.|additional attraction, wouldn't it?  You have a delightful opportunity now of paying me a compliment, Windermere. But you are not very
599|35|MRS. ERLYNNE.|clever at paying compliments.  I am afraid Margaret doesn't encourage you in that excellent habit.  It's a great mistake on her part.  When
600|36|MRS. ERLYNNE.|men give up saying what is charming, they give up thinking what is charming.  But seriously, what do you say to 2000 pounds?  2500 pounds, I
601|37|MRS. ERLYNNE.|think.  In modern life margin is everything.  Windermere, don't you think the world an intensely amusing place?  I do!
602|0||(Exit on terrace with LORD WINDERMERE.  Music strikes up in ball- room.)
603|146|LADY WINDERMERE.|To stay in this house any longer is impossible. To-night a man who loves me offered me his whole life.  I refused it.  It was foolish of me.
604|147|LADY WINDERMERE.| I will offer him mine now.  I will give him mine.  I will go to him!  (Puts on cloak and goes to the door, then turns back.  Sits down at
605|148|LADY WINDERMERE.|table and writes a letter, puts it into an envelope, and leaves it on table.)  Arthur has never understood me.  When he reads this, he will.
606|149|LADY WINDERMERE.| He may do as he chooses now with his life.  I have done with mine as I think best, as I think right.  It is he who has broken the bond of
607|150|LADY WINDERMERE.|marriage-- not I.  I only break its bondage.
608|0||(Exit.)
609|0||(PARKER enters L. and crosses towards the ball-room R.  Enter MRS. ERLYNNE.)
610|38|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Is Lady Windermere in the ball-room?
611|16|PARKER.|Her ladyship has just gone out.
612|39|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Gone out?  She's not on the terrace?
613|17|PARKER.|No, madam.  Her ladyship has just gone out of the house.
614|40|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Starts, and looks at the servant with a puzzled expression in her face.)  Out of the house?
615|18|PARKER.|Yes, madam--her ladyship told me she had left a letter for his lordship on the table.
616|41|MRS. ERLYNNE.|A letter for Lord Windermere?
617|19|PARKER.|Yes, madam.
618|42|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Thank you.
619|0||(Exit PARKER.  The music in the ball-room stops.)  Gone out of her house!  A letter addressed to her husband!  (Goes over to bureau and
620|0||looks at letter.  Takes it up and lays it down again with a shudder of fear.)  No, no!  It would be impossible!  Life doesn't repeat its
621|0||tragedies like that!  Oh, why does this horrible fancy come across me?  Why do I remember now the one moment of my life I most wish to
622|0||forget?  Does life repeat its tragedies?  (Tears letter open and reads it, then sinks down into a chair with a gesture of anguish.)  Oh, how
623|0||terrible!  The same words that twenty years ago I wrote to her father! and how bitterly I have been punished for it!  No; my punishment, my
624|0||real punishment is to- night, is now!  (Still seated R.)
625|0||(Enter LORD WINDERMERE L.U.E.)
626|65|LORD WINDERMERE.|Have you said good-night to my wife?  (Comes C.)
627|43|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Crushing letter in her hand.)  Yes.
628|66|LORD WINDERMERE.|Where is she?
629|44|MRS. ERLYNNE.|She is very tired.  She has gone to bed.  She said she had a headache.
630|67|LORD WINDERMERE.|I must go to her.  You'll excuse me?
631|45|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Rising hurriedly.)  Oh, no!  It's nothing serious. She's only very tired, that is all.  Besides, there are people still in the supper-room.
632|46|MRS. ERLYNNE.| She wants you to make her apologies to them.  She said she didn't wish to be disturbed.  (Drops letter.) She asked me to tell you!
633|68|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Picks up letter.)  You have dropped something.
634|47|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Oh yes, thank you, that is mine.  (Puts out her hand to take it.)
635|69|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Still looking at letter.)  But it's my wife's handwriting, isn't it?
636|48|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Takes the letter quickly.)  Yes, it's--an address. Will you ask them to call my carriage, please?
637|70|LORD WINDERMERE.|Certainly.
638|0||(Goes L. and Exit.)
639|49|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Thanks!  What can I do?  What can I do?  I feel a passion awakening within me that I never felt before.  What can it mean?  The daughter
640|50|MRS. ERLYNNE.|must not be like the mother--that would be terrible.  How can I save her?  How can I save my child?  A moment may ruin a life.  Who knows
641|51|MRS. ERLYNNE.|that better than I?  Windermere must be got out of the house; that is absolutely necessary.  (Goes L.)  But how shall I do it?  It must be
642|52|MRS. ERLYNNE.|done somehow.  Ah!
643|0||(Enter LORD AUGUSTUS R.U.E. carrying bouquet.)
644|22|LORD AUGUSTUS.|Dear lady, I am in such suspense!  May I not have an answer to my request?
645|53|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Lord Augustus, listen to me.  You are to take Lord Windermere down to your club at once, and keep him there as long as possible.  You
646|54|MRS. ERLYNNE.|understand?
647|23|LORD AUGUSTUS.|But you said you wished me to keep early hours!
648|55|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Nervously.)  Do what I tell you.  Do what I tell you.
649|24|LORD AUGUSTUS.|And my reward?
650|56|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Your reward?  Your reward?  Oh! ask me that to- morrow.  But don't let Windermere out of your sight to-night.  If you do I will never
651|57|MRS. ERLYNNE.|forgive you.  I will never speak to you again. I'll have nothing to do with you.  Remember you are to keep Windermere at your club, and
652|58|MRS. ERLYNNE.|don't let him come back to-night.
653|0||(Exit L.)
654|25|LORD AUGUSTUS.|Well, really, I might be her husband already. Positively I might.  (Follows her in a bewildered manner.)
655|0||THIRD ACT
656|0||Lord Darlington's Rooms.  A large sofa is in front of fireplace R. At the back of the stage a curtain is drawn across the window. Doors L.
657|0||and R.  Table R. with writing materials.  Table C. with syphons, glasses, and Tantalus frame.  Table L. with cigar and cigarette box.  Lamps
658|0||lit.
659|151|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Standing by the fireplace.)  Why doesn't he come?  This waiting is horrible.  He should be here.  Why is he not here, to wake by passionate
660|152|LADY WINDERMERE.|words some fire within me?  I am cold-- cold as a loveless thing.  Arthur must have read my letter by this time.  If he cared for me, he
661|153|LADY WINDERMERE.|would have come after me, would have taken me back by force.  But he doesn't care.  He's entrammelled by this woman--fascinated by
662|154|LADY WINDERMERE.|her--dominated by her.  If a woman wants to hold a man, she has merely to appeal to what is worst in him. We make gods of men and they leave
663|155|LADY WINDERMERE.|us.  Others make brutes of them and they fawn and are faithful.  How hideous life is! . . . Oh! it was mad of me to come here, horribly mad.
664|156|LADY WINDERMERE.| And yet, which is the worst, I wonder, to be at the mercy of a man who loves one, or the wife of a man who in one's own house dishonours
665|157|LADY WINDERMERE.|one?  What woman knows?  What woman in the whole world?  But will he love me always, this man to whom I am giving my life?  What do I bring
666|158|LADY WINDERMERE.|him?  Lips that have lost the note of joy, eyes that are blinded by tears, chill hands and icy heart.  I bring him nothing.  I must go
667|159|LADY WINDERMERE.|back-- no; I can't go back, my letter has put me in their power--Arthur would not take me back!  That fatal letter!  No!  Lord Darlington
668|160|LADY WINDERMERE.|leaves England to-morrow.  I will go with him--I have no choice. (Sits down for a few moments.  Then starts up and puts on her cloak.)  No,
669|161|LADY WINDERMERE.|no!  I will go back, let Arthur do with me what he pleases.  I can't wait here.  It has been madness my coming.  I must go at once.  As for
670|162|LADY WINDERMERE.|Lord Darlington--Oh! here he is!  What shall I do?  What can I say to him?  Will he let me go away at all? I have heard that men are brutal,
671|163|LADY WINDERMERE.|horrible . . . Oh!  (Hides her face in her hands.)
672|0||(Enter MRS. ERLYNNE L.)
673|59|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Lady Windermere!  (LADY WINDERMERE starts and looks up.  Then recoils in contempt.)  Thank Heaven I am in time.  You must go back to your
674|60|MRS. ERLYNNE.|husband's house immediately.
675|164|LADY WINDERMERE.|Must?
676|61|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Authoritatively.)  Yes, you must!  There is not a second to be lost.  Lord Darlington may return at any moment.
677|165|LADY WINDERMERE.|Don't come near me!
678|62|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Oh!  You are on the brink of ruin, you are on the brink of a hideous precipice.  You must leave this place at once, my carriage is waiting
679|63|MRS. ERLYNNE.|at the corner of the street.  You must come with me and drive straight home.
680|0||(LADY WINDERMERE throws off her cloak and flings it on the sofa.)
681|0||What are you doing?
682|166|LADY WINDERMERE.|Mrs. Erlynne--if you had not come here, I would have gone back.  But now that I see you, I feel that nothing in the whole world would induce
683|167|LADY WINDERMERE.|me to live under the same roof as Lord Windermere.  You fill me with horror.  There is something about you that stirs the wildest--rage
684|168|LADY WINDERMERE.|within me.  And I know why you are here.  My husband sent you to lure me back that I might serve as a blind to whatever relations exist
685|169|LADY WINDERMERE.|between you and him.
686|64|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Oh!  You don't think that--you can't.
687|170|LADY WINDERMERE.|Go back to my husband, Mrs. Erlynne.  He belongs to you and not to me.  I suppose he is afraid of a scandal.  Men are such cowards.  They
688|171|LADY WINDERMERE.|outrage every law of the world, and are afraid of the world's tongue.  But he had better prepare himself. He shall have a scandal.  He shall
689|172|LADY WINDERMERE.|have the worst scandal there has been in London for years.  He shall see his name in every vile paper, mine on every hideous placard.
690|65|MRS. ERLYNNE.|No--no -
691|173|LADY WINDERMERE.|Yes! he shall.  Had he come himself, I admit I would have gone back to the life of degradation you and he had prepared for me--I was going
692|174|LADY WINDERMERE.|back--but to stay himself at home, and to send you as his messenger--oh! it was infamous--infamous.
693|66|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(C.)  Lady Windermere, you wrong me horribly--you wrong your husband horribly.  He doesn't know you are here--he thinks you are safe in your
694|67|MRS. ERLYNNE.|own house.  He thinks you are asleep in your own room.  He never read the mad letter you wrote to him!
695|175|LADY WINDERMERE.|(R.)  Never read it!
696|68|MRS. ERLYNNE.|No--he knows nothing about it.
697|176|LADY WINDERMERE.|How simple you think me!  (Going to her.)  You are lying to me!
698|69|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Restraining herself.)  I am not.  I am telling you the truth.
699|177|LADY WINDERMERE.|If my husband didn't read my letter, how is it that you are here?  Who told you I had left the house you were shameless enough to enter? 
700|178|LADY WINDERMERE.|Who told you where I had gone to?  My husband told you, and sent you to decoy me back.  (Crosses L.)
701|70|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(R.C.)  Your husband has never seen the letter.  I-- saw it, I opened it.  I--read it.
702|179|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Turning to her.)  You opened a letter of mine to my husband?  You wouldn't dare!
703|71|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Dare!  Oh! to save you from the abyss into which you are falling, there is nothing in the world I would not dare, nothing in the whole
704|72|MRS. ERLYNNE.|world.  Here is the letter.  Your husband has never read it.  He never shall read it.  (Going to fireplace.)  It should never have been
705|73|MRS. ERLYNNE.|written.  (Tears it and throws it into the fire.)
706|180|LADY WINDERMERE.|(With infinite contempt in her voice and look.) How do I know that that was my letter after all?  You seem to think the commonest device can
707|181|LADY WINDERMERE.|take me in!
708|74|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Oh! why do you disbelieve everything I tell you? What object do you think I have in coming here, except to save you from utter ruin, to save
709|75|MRS. ERLYNNE.|you from the consequence of a hideous mistake?  That letter that is burnt now WAS your letter.  I swear it to you!
710|182|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Slowly.)  You took good care to burn it before I had examined it.  I cannot trust you.  You, whose whole life is a lie, could you speak the
711|183|LADY WINDERMERE.|truth about anything?  (Sits down.)
712|76|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Hurriedly.)  Think as you like about me--say what you choose against me, but go back, go back to the husband you love.
713|184|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Sullenly.)  I do NOT love him!
714|77|MRS. ERLYNNE.|You do, and you know that he loves you.
715|185|LADY WINDERMERE.|He does not understand what love is.  He understands it as little as you do--but I see what you want.  It would be a great advantage for you
716|186|LADY WINDERMERE.|to get me back.  Dear Heaven! what a life I would have then!  Living at the mercy of a woman who has neither mercy nor pity in her, a woman
717|187|LADY WINDERMERE.|whom it is an infamy to meet, a degradation to know, a vile woman, a woman who comes between husband and wife!
718|78|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(With a gesture of despair.)  Lady Windermere, Lady Windermere, don't say such terrible things.  You don't know how terrible they are, how
719|79|MRS. ERLYNNE.|terrible and how unjust.  Listen, you must listen!  Only go back to your husband, and I promise you never to communicate with him again on
720|80|MRS. ERLYNNE.|any pretext--never to see him--never to have anything to do with his life or yours.  The money that he gave me, he gave me not through love,
721|81|MRS. ERLYNNE.|but through hatred, not in worship, but in contempt.  The hold I have over him -
722|188|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Rising.)  Ah! you admit you have a hold!
723|82|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Yes, and I will tell you what it is.  It is his love for you, Lady Windermere.
724|189|LADY WINDERMERE.|You expect me to believe that?
725|83|MRS. ERLYNNE.|You must believe it!  It is true.  It is his love for you that has made him submit to--oh! call it what you like, tyranny, threats, anything
726|84|MRS. ERLYNNE.|you choose.  But it is his love for you. His desire to spare you--shame, yes, shame and disgrace.
727|190|LADY WINDERMERE.|What do you mean?  You are insolent!  What have I to do with you?
728|85|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Humbly.)  Nothing.  I know it--but I tell you that your husband loves you--that you may never meet with such love again in your whole
729|86|MRS. ERLYNNE.|life--that such love you will never meet--and that if you throw it away, the day may come when you will starve for love and it will not be
730|87|MRS. ERLYNNE.|given to you, beg for love and it will be denied you--Oh! Arthur loves you!
731|191|LADY WINDERMERE.|Arthur?  And you tell me there is nothing between you?
732|88|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Lady Windermere, before Heaven your husband is guiltless of all offence towards you!  And I--I tell you that had it ever occurred to me that
733|89|MRS. ERLYNNE.|such a monstrous suspicion would have entered your mind, I would have died rather than have crossed your life or his--oh! died, gladly died!
734|90|MRS. ERLYNNE.| (Moves away to sofa R.)
735|192|LADY WINDERMERE.|You talk as if you had a heart.  Women like you have no hearts.  Heart is not in you.  You are bought and sold. (Sits L.C.)
736|91|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Starts, with a gesture of pain.  Then restrains herself, and comes over to where LADY WINDERMERE is sitting.  As she speaks, she stretches
737|92|MRS. ERLYNNE.|out her hands towards her, but does not dare to touch her.)  Believe what you choose about me.  I am not worth a moment's sorrow.  But don't
738|93|MRS. ERLYNNE.|spoil your beautiful young life on my account!  You don't know what may be in store for you, unless you leave this house at once.  You don't
739|94|MRS. ERLYNNE.|know what it is to fall into the pit, to be despised, mocked, abandoned, sneered at--to be an outcast! to find the door shut against one, to
740|95|MRS. ERLYNNE.|have to creep in by hideous byways, afraid every moment lest the mask should be stripped from one's face, and all the while to hear the
741|96|MRS. ERLYNNE.|laughter, the horrible laughter of the world, a thing more tragic than all the tears the world has ever shed.  You don't know what it is. 
742|97|MRS. ERLYNNE.|One pays for one's sin, and then one pays again, and all one's life one pays.  You must never know that.--As for me, if suffering be an
743|98|MRS. ERLYNNE.|expiation, then at this moment I have expiated all my faults, whatever they have been; for to-night you have made a heart in one who had it
744|99|MRS. ERLYNNE.|not, made it and broken it.--But let that pass.  I may have wrecked my own life, but I will not let you wreck yours.  You- -why, you are a
745|100|MRS. ERLYNNE.|mere girl, you would be lost.  You haven't got the kind of brains that enables a woman to get back.  You have neither the wit nor the
746|101|MRS. ERLYNNE.|courage.  You couldn't stand dishonour!  No!  Go back, Lady Windermere, to the husband who loves you, whom you love. You have a child, Lady
747|102|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Windermere.  Go back to that child who even now, in pain or in joy, may be calling to you.  (LADY WINDERMERE rises.)  God gave you that
748|103|MRS. ERLYNNE.|child.  He will require from you that you make his life fine, that you watch over him.  What answer will you make to God if his life is
749|104|MRS. ERLYNNE.|ruined through you?  Back to your house, Lady Windermere--your husband loves you!  He has never swerved for a moment from the love he bears
750|105|MRS. ERLYNNE.|you.  But even if he had a thousand loves, you must stay with your child.  If he was harsh to you, you must stay with your child.  If he
751|106|MRS. ERLYNNE.|ill-treated you, you must stay with your child.  If he abandoned you, your place is with your child.
752|0||(LADY WINDERMERE bursts into tears and buries her face in her hands.)
753|0||(Rushing to her.)  Lady Windermere!
754|193|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Holding out her hands to her, helplessly, as a child might do.)  Take me home.  Take me home.
755|107|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Is about to embrace her.  Then restrains herself. There is a look of wonderful joy in her face.)  Come!  Where is your cloak?  (Getting it
756|108|MRS. ERLYNNE.|from sofa.)  Here.  Put it on.  Come at once!
757|0||(They go to the door.)
758|194|LADY WINDERMERE.|Stop!  Don't you hear voices?
759|109|MRS. ERLYNNE.|No, no!  There was no one!
760|195|LADY WINDERMERE.|Yes, there is!  Listen!  Oh! that is my husband's voice!  He is coming in!  Save me!  Oh, it's some plot!  You have sent for him.
761|0||(Voices outside.)
762|110|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Silence!  I'm here to save you, if I can.  But I fear it is too late!  There! (Points to the curtain across the window.)  The first chance
763|111|MRS. ERLYNNE.|you have, slip out, if you ever get a chance!
764|196|LADY WINDERMERE.|But you?
765|112|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Oh! never mind me.  I'll face them.
766|0||(LADY WINDERMERE hides herself behind the curtain.)
767|26|LORD AUGUSTUS.|(Outside.)  Nonsense, dear Windermere, you must not leave me!
768|113|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Lord Augustus!  Then it is I who am lost! (Hesitates for a moment, then looks round and sees door R., and exits through it.)
769|0||(Enter LORD DARLINGTON, MR. DUMBY, LORD WINDERMERE, LORD AUGUSTUS LORTON, and MR. CECIL GRAHAM.
770|19|DUMBY.|What a nuisance their turning us out of the club at this hour!  It's only two o'clock.  (Sinks into a chair.)  The lively part of the
771|20|DUMBY.|evening is only just beginning.  (Yawns and closes his eyes.)
772|71|LORD WINDERMERE.|It is very good of you, Lord Darlington, allowing Augustus to force our company on you, but I'm afraid I can't stay long.
773|88|LORD DARLINGTON.|Really!  I am so sorry!  You'll take a cigar, won't you?
774|72|LORD WINDERMERE.|Thanks!  (Sits down.)
775|27|LORD AUGUSTUS.|(To LORD WINDERMERE.)  My dear boy, you must not dream of going.  I have a great deal to talk to you about, of demmed importance, too. 
776|28|LORD AUGUSTUS.|(Sits down with him at L. table.)
777|12|CECIL GRAHAM.|Oh!  We all know what that is!  Tuppy can't talk about anything but Mrs. Erlynne.
778|73|LORD WINDERMERE.|Well, that is no business of yours, is it, Cecil?
779|13|CECIL GRAHAM.|None!  That is why it interests me.  My own business always bores me to death.  I prefer other people's.
780|89|LORD DARLINGTON.|Have something to drink, you fellows.  Cecil, you'll have a whisky and soda?
781|14|CECIL GRAHAM.|Thanks.  (Goes to table with LORD DARLINGTON.)  Mrs. Erlynne looked very handsome to-night, didn't she?
782|90|LORD DARLINGTON.|I am not one of her admirers.
783|15|CECIL GRAHAM.|I usen't to be, but I am now.  Why! she actually made me introduce her to poor dear Aunt Caroline.  I believe she is going to lunch there.
784|91|LORD DARLINGTON.|(In Purple.)  No?
785|16|CECIL GRAHAM.|She is, really.
786|92|LORD DARLINGTON.|Excuse me, you fellows.  I'm going away to- morrow.  And I have to write a few letters.  (Goes to writing table and sits down.)
787|21|DUMBY.|Clever woman, Mrs. Erlynne.
788|17|CECIL GRAHAM.|Hallo, Dumby!  I thought you were asleep.
789|22|DUMBY.|I am, I usually am!
790|29|LORD AUGUSTUS.|A very clever woman.  Knows perfectly well what a demmed fool I am--knows it as well as I do myself.
791|0||(CECIL GRAHAM comes towards him laughing.)
792|0||Ah, you may laugh, my boy, but it is a great thing to come across a woman who thoroughly understands one.
793|23|DUMBY.|It is an awfully dangerous thing.  They always end by marrying one.
794|18|CECIL GRAHAM.|But I thought, Tuppy, you were never going to see her again!  Yes! you told me so yesterday evening at the club.  You said you'd heard -
795|0||(Whispering to him.)
796|30|LORD AUGUSTUS.|Oh, she's explained that.
797|19|CECIL GRAHAM.|And the Wiesbaden affair?
798|31|LORD AUGUSTUS.|She's explained that too.
799|24|DUMBY.|And her income, Tuppy?  Has she explained that?
800|32|LORD AUGUSTUS.|(In a very serious voice.)  She's going to explain that to-morrow.
801|0||(CECIL GRAHAM goes back to C. table.)
802|25|DUMBY.|Awfully commercial, women nowadays.  Our grandmothers threw their caps over the mills, of course, but, by Jove, their granddaughters only
803|26|DUMBY.|throw their caps over mills that can raise the wind for them.
804|33|LORD AUGUSTUS.|You want to make her out a wicked woman.  She is not!
805|20|CECIL GRAHAM.|Oh!  Wicked women bother one.  Good women bore one. That is the only difference between them.
806|34|LORD AUGUSTUS.|(Puffing a cigar.)  Mrs. Erlynne has a future before her.
807|27|DUMBY.|Mrs. Erlynne has a past before her.
808|35|LORD AUGUSTUS.|I prefer women with a past.  They're always so demmed amusing to talk to.
809|21|CECIL GRAHAM.|Well, you'll have lots of topics of conversation with HER, Tuppy.  (Rising and going to him.)
810|36|LORD AUGUSTUS.|You're getting annoying, dear-boy; you're getting demmed annoying.
811|22|CECIL GRAHAM.|(Puts his hands on his shoulders.)  Now, Tuppy, you've lost your figure and you've lost your character.  Don't lose your temper; you have
812|23|CECIL GRAHAM.|only got one.
813|37|LORD AUGUSTUS.|My dear boy, if I wasn't the most good-natured man in London -
814|24|CECIL GRAHAM.|We'd treat you with more respect, wouldn't we, Tuppy?  (Strolls away.)
815|28|DUMBY.|The youth of the present day are quite monstrous.  They have absolutely no respect for dyed hair.  (LORD AUGUSTUS looks round angrily.)
816|25|CECIL GRAHAM.|Mrs. Erlynne has a very great respect for dear Tuppy.
817|29|DUMBY.|Then Mrs. Erlynne sets an admirable example to the rest of her sex.  It is perfectly brutal the way most women nowadays behave to men who
818|30|DUMBY.|are not their husbands.
819|74|LORD WINDERMERE.|Dumby, you are ridiculous, and Cecil, you let your tongue run away with you.  You must leave Mrs. Erlynne alone. You don't really know
820|75|LORD WINDERMERE.|anything about her, and you're always talking scandal against her.
821|26|CECIL GRAHAM.|(Coming towards him L.C.)  My dear Arthur, I never talk scandal.  _I_ only talk gossip.
822|76|LORD WINDERMERE.|What is the difference between scandal and gossip?
823|27|CECIL GRAHAM.|Oh! gossip is charming!  History is merely gossip. But scandal is gossip made tedious by morality.  Now, I never moralise.  A man who
824|28|CECIL GRAHAM.|moralises is usually a hypocrite, and a woman who moralises is invariably plain.  There is nothing in the whole world so unbecoming to a
825|29|CECIL GRAHAM.|woman as a Nonconformist conscience.  And most women know it, I'm glad to say.
826|38|LORD AUGUSTUS.|Just my sentiments, dear boy, just my sentiments.
827|30|CECIL GRAHAM.|Sorry to hear it, Tuppy; whenever people agree with me, I always feel I must be wrong.
828|39|LORD AUGUSTUS.|My dear boy, when I was your age -
829|31|CECIL GRAHAM.|But you never were, Tuppy, and you never will be. (Goes up C.)  I say, Darlington, let us have some cards.  You'll play, Arthur, won't you?
830|77|LORD WINDERMERE.|No, thanks, Cecil.
831|31|DUMBY.|(With a sigh.)  Good heavens! how marriage ruins a man! It's as demoralising as cigarettes, and far more expensive.
832|32|CECIL GRAHAM.|You'll play, of course, Tuppy?
833|40|LORD AUGUSTUS.|(Pouring himself out a brandy and soda at table.) Can't, dear boy.  Promised Mrs. Erlynne never to play or drink again.
834|33|CECIL GRAHAM.|Now, my dear Tuppy, don't be led astray into the paths of virtue.  Reformed, you would be perfectly tedious.  That is the worst of women. 
835|34|CECIL GRAHAM.|They always want one to be good.  And if we are good, when they meet us, they don't love us at all.  They like to find us quite
836|35|CECIL GRAHAM.|irretrievably bad, and to leave us quite unattractively good.
837|93|LORD DARLINGTON.|(Rising from R. table, where he has been writing letters.)  They always do find us bad!
838|32|DUMBY.|I don't think we are bad.  I think we are all good, except Tuppy.
839|94|LORD DARLINGTON.|No, we are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.  (Sits down at C. table.)
840|33|DUMBY.|We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars?  Upon my word, you are very romantic to-night, Darlington.
841|36|CECIL GRAHAM.|Too romantic!  You must be in love.  Who is the girl?
842|95|LORD DARLINGTON.|The woman I love is not free, or thinks she isn't.  (Glances instinctively at LORD WINDERMERE while he speaks.)
843|37|CECIL GRAHAM.|A married woman, then!  Well, there's nothing in the world like the devotion of a married woman.  It's a thing no married man knows anything
844|38|CECIL GRAHAM.|about.
845|96|LORD DARLINGTON.|Oh! she doesn't love me.  She is a good woman. She is the only good woman I have ever met in my life.
846|39|CECIL GRAHAM.|The only good woman you have ever met in your life?
847|97|LORD DARLINGTON.|Yes!
848|40|CECIL GRAHAM.|(Lighting a cigarette.)  Well, you are a lucky fellow!  Why, I have met hundreds of good women.  I never seem to meet any but good women. 
849|41|CECIL GRAHAM.|The world is perfectly packed with good women.  To know them is a middle-class education.
850|98|LORD DARLINGTON.|This woman has purity and innocence.  She has everything we men have lost.
851|42|CECIL GRAHAM.|My dear fellow, what on earth should we men do going about with purity and innocence?  A carefully thought-out buttonhole is much more
852|43|CECIL GRAHAM.|effective.
853|34|DUMBY.|She doesn't really love you then?
854|99|LORD DARLINGTON.|No, she does not!
855|35|DUMBY.|I congratulate you, my dear fellow.  In this world there are only two tragedies.  One is not getting what one wants, and the other is
856|36|DUMBY.|getting it.  The last is much the worst; the last is a real tragedy!  But I am interested to hear she does not love you. How long could you
857|37|DUMBY.|love a woman who didn't love you, Cecil?
858|44|CECIL GRAHAM.|A woman who didn't love me?  Oh, all my life!
859|38|DUMBY.|So could I.  But it's so difficult to meet one.
860|100|LORD DARLINGTON.|How can you be so conceited, DUMBY?
861|39|DUMBY.|I didn't say it as a matter of conceit.  I said it as a matter of regret.  I have been wildly, madly adored.  I am sorry I have.  It has
862|40|DUMBY.|been an immense nuisance.  I should like to be allowed a little time to myself now and then.
863|41|LORD AUGUSTUS.|(Looking round.)  Time to educate yourself, I suppose.
864|41|DUMBY.|No, time to forget all I have learned.  That is much more important, dear Tuppy.  (LORD AUGUSTUS moves uneasily in his chair.)
865|101|LORD DARLINGTON.|What cynics you fellows are!
866|45|CECIL GRAHAM.|What is a cynic?  (Sitting on the back of the sofa.)
867|102|LORD DARLINGTON.|A man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.
868|46|CECIL GRAHAM.|And a sentimentalist, my dear Darlington, is a man who sees an absurd value in everything, and doesn't know the market price of any single
869|47|CECIL GRAHAM.|thing.
870|103|LORD DARLINGTON.|You always amuse me, Cecil.  You talk as if you were a man of experience.
871|48|CECIL GRAHAM.|I am.  (Moves up to front off fireplace.)
872|104|LORD DARLINGTON.|You are far too young!
873|49|CECIL GRAHAM.|That is a great error.  Experience is a question of instinct about life.  I have got it.  Tuppy hasn't.  Experience is the name Tuppy gives
874|50|CECIL GRAHAM.|to his mistakes.  That is all.  (LORD AUGUSTUS looks round indignantly.)
875|42|DUMBY.|Experience is the name every one gives to their mistakes.
876|51|CECIL GRAHAM.|(Standing with his back to the fireplace.)  One shouldn't commit any.  (Sees LADY WINDERMERE'S fan on sofa.)
877|43|DUMBY.|Life would be very dull without them.
878|52|CECIL GRAHAM.|Of course you are quite faithful to this woman you are in love with, Darlington, to this good woman?
879|105|LORD DARLINGTON.|Cecil, if on really loves a woman, all other women in the world become absolutely meaningless to one.  Love changes one--_I_ am changed.
880|53|CECIL GRAHAM.|Dear me!  How very interesting!  Tuppy, I want to talk to you.  (LORD AUGUSTUS takes no notice.)
881|44|DUMBY.|It's no use talking to Tuppy.  You might just as well talk to a brick wall.
882|54|CECIL GRAHAM.|But I like talking to a brick wall--it's the only thing in the world that never contradicts me!  Tuppy!
883|42|LORD AUGUSTUS.|Well, what is it?  What is it?  (Rising and going over to CECIL GRAHAM.)
884|55|CECIL GRAHAM.|Come over here.  I want you particularly.  (Aside.) Darlington has been moralising and talking about the purity of love, and that sort of
885|56|CECIL GRAHAM.|thing, and he has got some woman in his rooms all the time.
886|43|LORD AUGUSTUS.|No, really! really!
887|57|CECIL GRAHAM.|(In a low voice.)  Yes, here is her fan.  (Points to the fan.)
888|44|LORD AUGUSTUS.|(Chuckling.)  By Jove!  By Jove!
889|78|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Up by door.)  I am really off now, Lord Darlington.  I am sorry you are leaving England so soon.  Pray call on us when you come back!  My
890|79|LORD WINDERMERE.|wife and I will be charmed to see you!
891|106|LORD DARLINGTON.|(Up sage with LORD WINDERMERE.)  I am afraid I shall be away for many years.  Good-night!
892|58|CECIL GRAHAM.|Arthur!
893|80|LORD WINDERMERE.|What?
894|59|CECIL GRAHAM.|I want to speak to you for a moment.  No, do come!
895|81|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Putting on his coat.)  I can't--I'm off!
896|60|CECIL GRAHAM.|It is something very particular.  It will interest you enormously.
897|82|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Smiling.)  It is some of your nonsense, Cecil.
898|61|CECIL GRAHAM.|It isn't!  It isn't really.
899|45|LORD AUGUSTUS.|(Going to him.)  My dear fellow, you mustn't go yet.  I have a lot to talk to you about.  And Cecil has something to show you.
900|83|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Walking over.)  Well, what is it?
901|62|CECIL GRAHAM.|Darlington has got a woman here in his rooms.  Here is her fan.  Amusing, isn't it?  (A pause.)
902|84|LORD WINDERMERE.|Good God!  (Seizes the fan--DUMBY rises.)
903|63|CECIL GRAHAM.|What is the matter?
904|85|LORD WINDERMERE.|Lord Darlington!
905|107|LORD DARLINGTON.|(Turning round.)  Yes!
906|86|LORD WINDERMERE.|What is my wife's fan doing here in your rooms? Hands off, Cecil.  Don't touch me.
907|108|LORD DARLINGTON.|Your wife's fan?
908|87|LORD WINDERMERE.|Yes, here it is!
909|109|LORD DARLINGTON.|(Walking towards him.)  I don't know!
910|88|LORD WINDERMERE.|You must know.  I demand an explanation.  Don't hold me, you fool.  (To CECIL GRAHAM.)
911|110|LORD DARLINGTON.|(Aside.)  She is here after all!
912|89|LORD WINDERMERE.|Speak, sir!  Why is my wife's fan here?  Answer me!  By God!  I'll search your rooms, and if my wife's here, I'll-- (Moves.)
913|111|LORD DARLINGTON.|You shall not search my rooms.  You have no right to do so.  I forbid you!
914|90|LORD WINDERMERE.|You scoundrel!  I'll not leave your room till I have searched every corner of it!  What moves behind that curtain? (Rushes towards the
915|91|LORD WINDERMERE.|curtain C.)
916|114|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Enters behind R.)  Lord Windermere!
917|92|LORD WINDERMERE.|Mrs. Erlynne!
918|0||(Every one starts and turns round.  LADY WINDERMERE slips out from behind the curtain and glides from the room L.)
919|115|MRS. ERLYNNE.|I am afraid I took your wife's fan in mistake for my own, when I was leaving your house to-night.  I am so sorry. (Takes fan from him.  LORD
920|116|MRS. ERLYNNE.|WINDERMERE looks at her in contempt. LORD DARLINGTON in mingled astonishment and anger.  LORD AUGUSTUS turns away.  The other men smile at
921|117|MRS. ERLYNNE.|each other.)
922|0||FOURTH ACT
923|197|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Lying on sofa.)  How can I tell him?  I can't tell him.  It would kill me.  I wonder what happened after I escaped from that horrible room.
924|198|LADY WINDERMERE.| Perhaps she told them the true reason of her being there, and the real meaning of that--fatal fan of mine.  Oh, if he knows--how can I look
925|199|LADY WINDERMERE.|him in the face again? He would never forgive me.  (Touches bell.)  How securely one thinks one lives--out of reach of temptation, sin,
926|200|LADY WINDERMERE.|folly.  And then suddenly--Oh!  Life is terrible.  It rules us, we do not rule it.
927|0||(Enter ROSALIE R.)
928|1|ROSALIE.|Did your ladyship ring for me?
929|201|LADY WINDERMERE.|Yes.  Have you found out at what time Lord Windermere came in last night?
930|2|ROSALIE.|His lordship did not come in till five o'clock.
931|202|LADY WINDERMERE.|Five o'clock?  He knocked at my door this morning, didn't he?
932|3|ROSALIE.|Yes, my lady--at half-past nine.  I told him your ladyship was not awake yet.
933|203|LADY WINDERMERE.|Did he say anything?
934|4|ROSALIE.|Something about your ladyship's fan.  I didn't quite catch what his lordship said.  Has the fan been lost, my lady?  I can't find it, and
935|5|ROSALIE.|Parker says it was not left in any of the rooms. He has looked in all of them and on the terrace as well.
936|204|LADY WINDERMERE.|It doesn't matter.  Tell Parker not to trouble. That will do.
937|0||(Exit ROSALIE.)
938|205|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Rising.)  She is sure to tell him.  I can fancy a person doing a wonderful act of self-sacrifice, doing it spontaneously, recklessly,
939|206|LADY WINDERMERE.|nobly--and afterwards finding out that it costs too much.  Why should she hesitate between her ruin and mine? . . . How strange!  I would
940|207|LADY WINDERMERE.|have publicly disgraced her in my own house.  She accepts public disgrace in the house of another to save me. . . . There is a bitter irony
941|208|LADY WINDERMERE.|in things, a bitter irony in the way we talk of good and bad women. . . . Oh, what a lesson! and what a pity that in life we only get our
942|209|LADY WINDERMERE.|lessons when they are of no use to us!  For even if she doesn't tell, I must.  Oh! the shame of it, the shame of it.  To tell it is to live
943|210|LADY WINDERMERE.|through it all again.  Actions are the first tragedy in life, words are the second.  Words are perhaps the worst.  Words are merciless. . .
944|211|LADY WINDERMERE.|Oh! (Starts as LORD WINDERMERE enters.)
945|93|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Kisses her.)  Margaret--how pale you look!
946|212|LADY WINDERMERE.|I slept very badly.
947|94|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Sitting on sofa with her.)  I am so sorry.  I came in dreadfully late, and didn't like to wake you.  You are crying, dear.
948|213|LADY WINDERMERE.|Yes, I am crying, for I have something to tell you, Arthur.
949|95|LORD WINDERMERE.|My dear child, you are not well.  You've been doing too much.  Let us go away to the country.  You'll be all right at Selby.  The season is
950|96|LORD WINDERMERE.|almost over.  There is no use staying on.  Poor darling!  We'll go away to-day, if you like. (Rises.)  We can easily catch the 3.40.  I'll
951|97|LORD WINDERMERE.|send a wire to Fannen.  (Crosses and sits down at table to write a telegram.)
952|214|LADY WINDERMERE.|Yes; let us go away to-day.  No; I can't go to- day, Arthur.  There is some one I must see before I leave town-- some one who has been kind
953|215|LADY WINDERMERE.|to me.
954|98|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Rising and leaning over sofa.)  Kind to you?
955|216|LADY WINDERMERE.|Far more than that.  (Rises and goes to him.)  I will tell you, Arthur, but only love me, love me as you used to love me.
956|99|LORD WINDERMERE.|Used to?  You are not thinking of that wretched woman who came here last night?  (Coming round and sitting R. of her.)  You don't still
957|100|LORD WINDERMERE.|imagine--no, you couldn't.
958|217|LADY WINDERMERE.|I don't.  I know now I was wrong and foolish.
959|101|LORD WINDERMERE.|It was very good of you to receive her last night--but you are never to see her again.
960|218|LADY WINDERMERE.|Why do you say that?  (A pause.)
961|102|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Holding her hand.)  Margaret, I thought Mrs. Erlynne was a woman more sinned against than sinning, as the phrase goes.  I thought she
962|103|LORD WINDERMERE.|wanted to be good, to get back into a place that she had lost by a moment's folly, to lead again a decent life. I believed what she told
963|104|LORD WINDERMERE.|me--I was mistaken in her.  She is bad--as bad as a woman can be.
964|219|LADY WINDERMERE.|Arthur, Arthur, don't talk so bitterly about any woman.  I don't think now that people can be divided into the good and the bad as though
965|220|LADY WINDERMERE.|they were two separate races or creations. What are called good women may have terrible things in them, mad moods of recklessness,
966|221|LADY WINDERMERE.|assertion, jealousy, sin.  Bad women, as they are termed, may have in them sorrow, repentance, pity, sacrifice.  And I don't think Mrs.
967|222|LADY WINDERMERE.|Erlynne a bad woman--I know she's not.
968|105|LORD WINDERMERE.|My dear child, the woman's impossible.  No matter what harm she tries to do us, you must never see her again.  She is inadmissible anywhere.
969|223|LADY WINDERMERE.|But I want to see her.  I want her to come here.
970|106|LORD WINDERMERE.|Never!
971|224|LADY WINDERMERE.|She came here once as YOUR guest.  She must come now as MINE.  That is but fair.
972|107|LORD WINDERMERE.|She should never have come here.
973|225|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Rising.)  It is too late, Arthur, to say that now.  (Moves away.)
974|108|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Rising.)  Margaret, if you knew where Mrs. Erlynne went last night, after she left this house, you would not sit in the same room with her.
975|109|LORD WINDERMERE.| It was absolutely shameless, the whole thing.
976|226|LADY WINDERMERE.|Arthur, I can't bear it any longer.  I must tell you.  Last night -
977|0||(Enter PARKER with a tray on which lie LADY WINDERMERE'S fan and a card.)
978|20|PARKER.|Mrs. Erlynne has called to return your ladyship's fan which she took away by mistake last night.  Mrs. Erlynne has written a message on the
979|21|PARKER.|card.
980|227|LADY WINDERMERE.|Oh, ask Mrs. Erlynne to be kind enough to come up.  (Reads card.)  Say I shall be very glad to see her.  (Exit PARKER.)  She wants to see
981|228|LADY WINDERMERE.|me, Arthur.
982|110|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Takes card and looks at it.)  Margaret, I BEG you not to.  Let me see her first, at any rate.  She's a very dangerous woman.  She is the
983|111|LORD WINDERMERE.|most dangerous woman I know.  You don't realise what you're doing.
984|229|LADY WINDERMERE.|It is right that I should see her.
985|112|LORD WINDERMERE.|My child, you may be on the brink of a great sorrow.  Don't go to meet it.  It is absolutely necessary that I should see her before you do.
986|230|LADY WINDERMERE.|Why should it be necessary?
987|0||(Enter PARKER.)
988|22|PARKER.|Mrs. Erlynne.
989|0||(Enter MRS. ERLYNNE.)
990|0||(Exit PARKER.)
991|118|MRS. ERLYNNE.|How do you do, Lady Windermere?  (To LORD WINDERMERE.)  How do you do?  Do you know, Lady Windermere, I am so sorry about your fan.  I can't
992|119|MRS. ERLYNNE.|imagine how I made such a silly mistake.  Most stupid of me.  And as I was driving in your direction, I thought I would take the opportunity
993|120|MRS. ERLYNNE.|of returning your property in person with many apologies for my carelessness, and of bidding you good-bye.
994|231|LADY WINDERMERE.|Good-bye?  (Moves towards sofa with MRS. ERLYNNE and sits down beside her.)  Are you going away, then, Mrs. Erlynne?
995|121|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Yes; I am going to live abroad again.  The English climate doesn't suit me.  My--heart is affected here, and that I don't like.  I prefer
996|122|MRS. ERLYNNE.|living in the south.  London is too full of fogs and--and serious people, Lord Windermere.  Whether the fogs produce the serious people or
997|123|MRS. ERLYNNE.|whether the serious people produce the fogs, I don't know, but the whole thing rather gets on my nerves, and so I'm leaving this afternoon
998|124|MRS. ERLYNNE.|by the Club Train.
999|232|LADY WINDERMERE.|This afternoon?  But I wanted so much to come and see you.
1000|125|MRS. ERLYNNE.|How kind of you!  But I am afraid I have to go.
1001|233|LADY WINDERMERE.|Shall I never see you again, Mrs. Erlynne?
1002|126|MRS. ERLYNNE.|I am afraid not.  Our lives lie too far apart.  But there is a little thing I would like you to do for me.  I want a photograph of you, Lady
1003|127|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Windermere--would you give me one?  You don't know how gratified I should be.
1004|234|LADY WINDERMERE.|Oh, with pleasure.  There is one on that table. I'll show it to you. (Goes across to the table.)
1005|113|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Coming up to MRS. ERLYNNE and speaking in a low voice.)  It is monstrous your intruding yourself here after your conduct last night.
1006|128|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(With an amused smile.)  My dear Windermere, manners before morals!
1007|235|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Returning.)  I'm afraid it is very flattering--I am not so pretty as that.  (Showing photograph.)
1008|129|MRS. ERLYNNE.|You are much prettier.  But haven't you got one of yourself with your little boy?
1009|236|LADY WINDERMERE.|I have.  Would you prefer one of those?
1010|130|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Yes.
1011|237|LADY WINDERMERE.|I'll go and get it for you, if you'll excuse me for a moment.  I have one upstairs.
1012|131|MRS. ERLYNNE.|So sorry, Lady Windermere, to give you so much trouble.
1013|238|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Moves to door R.)  No trouble at all, Mrs. Erlynne.
1014|132|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Thanks so much.
1015|0||(Exit LADY WINDERMERE R.)  You seem rather out of temper this morning, Windermere.  Why should you be?  Margaret and I get on charmingly
1016|0||together.
1017|114|LORD WINDERMERE.|I can't bear to see you with her.  Besides, you have not told me the truth, Mrs. Erlynne.
1018|133|MRS. ERLYNNE.|I have not told HER the truth, you mean.
1019|115|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Standing C.)  I sometimes wish you had.  I should have been spared then the misery, the anxiety, the annoyance of the last six months.  But
1020|116|LORD WINDERMERE.|rather than my wife should know--that the mother whom she was taught to consider as dead, the mother whom she has mourned as dead, is
1021|117|LORD WINDERMERE.|living--a divorced woman, going about under an assumed name, a bad woman preying upon life, as I know you now to be--rather than that, I was
1022|118|LORD WINDERMERE.|ready to supply you with money to pay bill after bill, extravagance after extravagance, to risk what occurred yesterday, the first quarrel I
1023|119|LORD WINDERMERE.|have ever had with my wife.  You don't understand what that means to me.  How could you? But I tell you that the only bitter words that ever
1024|120|LORD WINDERMERE.|came from those sweet lips of hers were on your account, and I hate to see you next her.  You sully the innocence that is in her. (Moves
1025|121|LORD WINDERMERE.|L.C.)  And then I used to think that with all your faults you were frank and honest.  You are not.
1026|134|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Why do you say that?
1027|122|LORD WINDERMERE.|You made me get you an invitation to my wife's ball.
1028|135|MRS. ERLYNNE.|For my daughter's ball--yes.
1029|123|LORD WINDERMERE.|You came, and within an hour of your leaving the house you are found in a man's rooms--you are disgraced before every one.  (Goes up stage
1030|124|LORD WINDERMERE.|C.)
1031|136|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Yes.
1032|125|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Turning round on her.)  Therefore I have a right to look upon you as what you are--a worthless, vicious woman.  I have the right to tell
1033|126|LORD WINDERMERE.|you never to enter this house, never to attempt to come near my wife -
1034|137|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Coldly.)  My daughter, you mean.
1035|127|LORD WINDERMERE.|You have no right to claim her as your daughter. You left her, abandoned her when she was but a child in the cradle, abandoned her for your
1036|128|LORD WINDERMERE.|lover, who abandoned you in turn.
1037|138|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Rising.)  Do you count that to his credit, Lord Windermere--or to mine?
1038|129|LORD WINDERMERE.|To his, now that I know you.
1039|139|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Take care--you had better be careful.
1040|130|LORD WINDERMERE.|Oh, I am not going to mince words for you.  I know you thoroughly.
1041|140|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Looks steadily at him.)  I question that.
1042|131|LORD WINDERMERE.|I DO know you.  For twenty years of your life you lived without your child, without a thought of your child.  One day you read in the papers
1043|132|LORD WINDERMERE.|that she had married a rich man.  You saw your hideous chance.  You knew that to spare her the ignominy of learning that a woman like you
1044|133|LORD WINDERMERE.|was her mother, I would endure anything.  You began your blackmailing,
1045|141|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Shrugging her shoulders.)  Don't use ugly words, Windermere.  They are vulgar.  I saw my chance, it is true, and took it.
1046|134|LORD WINDERMERE.|Yes, you took it--and spoiled it all last night by being found out.
1047|142|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(With a strange smile.)  You are quite right, I spoiled it all last night.
1048|135|LORD WINDERMERE.|And as for your blunder in taking my wife's fan from here and then leaving it about in Darlington's rooms, it is unpardonable.  I can't bear
1049|136|LORD WINDERMERE.|the sight of it now.  I shall never let my wife use it again.  The thing is soiled for me.  You should have kept it and not brought it back.
1050|143|MRS. ERLYNNE.|I think I shall keep it.  (Goes up.)  It's extremely pretty.  (Takes up fan.)  I shall ask Margaret to give it to me.
1051|137|LORD WINDERMERE.|I hope my wife will give it you.
1052|144|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Oh, I'm sure she will have no objection.
1053|138|LORD WINDERMERE.|I wish that at the same time she would give you a miniature she kisses every night before she prays--It's the miniature of a young
1054|139|LORD WINDERMERE.|innocent-looking girl with beautiful DARK hair.
1055|145|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Ah, yes, I remember.  How long ago that seems! (Goes to sofa and sits down.)  It was done before I was married. Dark hair and an innocent
1056|146|MRS. ERLYNNE.|expression were the fashion then, Windermere!  (A pause.)
1057|140|LORD WINDERMERE.|What do you mean by coming here this morning? What is your object?  (Crossing L.C. and sitting.)
1058|147|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(With a note of irony in her voice.)  To bid good- bye to my dear daughter, of course.  (LORD WINDERMERE bites his under lip in anger.  MRS.
1059|148|MRS. ERLYNNE.|ERLYNNE looks at him, and her voice and manner become serious.  In her accents at she talks there is a note of deep tragedy.  For a moment
1060|149|MRS. ERLYNNE.|she reveals herself.)  Oh, don't imagine I am going to have a pathetic scene with her, weep on her neck and tell her who I am, and all that
1061|150|MRS. ERLYNNE.|kind of thing.  I have no ambition to play the part of a mother.  Only once in my life like I known a mother's feelings.  That was last
1062|151|MRS. ERLYNNE.|night.  They were terrible--they made me suffer--they made me suffer too much.  For twenty years, as you say, I have lived childless,--I
1063|152|MRS. ERLYNNE.|want to live childless still.  (Hiding her feelings with a trivial laugh.) Besides, my dear Windermere, how on earth could I pose as a
1064|153|MRS. ERLYNNE.|mother with a grown-up daughter?  Margaret is twenty-one, and I have never admitted that I am more than twenty-nine, or thirty at the most.
1065|154|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Twenty-nine when there are pink shades, thirty when there are not. So you see what difficulties it would involve.  No, as far as I am
1066|155|MRS. ERLYNNE.|concerned, let your wife cherish the memory of this dead, stainless mother.  Why should I interfere with her illusions?  I find it hard
1067|156|MRS. ERLYNNE.|enough to keep my own.  I lost one illusion last night.  I thought I had no heart.  I find I have, and a heart doesn't suit me, Windermere. 
1068|157|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Somehow it doesn't go with modern dress.  It makes one look old.  (Takes up hand-mirror from table and looks into it.) And it spoils one's
1069|158|MRS. ERLYNNE.|career at critical moments.
1070|141|LORD WINDERMERE.|You fill me with horror--with absolute horror.
1071|159|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Rising.)  I suppose, Windermere, you would like me to retire into a convent, or become a hospital nurse, or something of that kind, as
1072|160|MRS. ERLYNNE.|people do in silly modern novels.  That is stupid of you, Arthur; in real life we don't do such things--not as long as we have any good
1073|161|MRS. ERLYNNE.|looks left, at any rate.  No--what consoles one nowadays is not repentance, but pleasure.  Repentance is quite out of date.  And besides, if
1074|162|MRS. ERLYNNE.|a woman really repents, she has to go to a bad dressmaker, otherwise no one believes in her.  And nothing in the world would induce me to do
1075|163|MRS. ERLYNNE.|that.  No; I am going to pass entirely out of your two lives.  My coming into them has been a mistake--I discovered that last night.
1076|142|LORD WINDERMERE.|A fatal mistake.
1077|164|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Smiling.)  Almost fatal.
1078|143|LORD WINDERMERE.|I am sorry now I did not tell my wife the whole thing at once.
1079|165|MRS. ERLYNNE.|I regret my bad actions.  You regret your good ones- -that is the difference between us.
1080|144|LORD WINDERMERE.|I don't trust you.  I WILL tell my wife.  It's better for her to know, and from me.  It will cause her infinite pain--it will humiliate her
1081|145|LORD WINDERMERE.|terribly, but it's right that she should know.
1082|166|MRS. ERLYNNE.|You propose to tell her?
1083|146|LORD WINDERMERE.|I am going to tell her.
1084|167|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Going up to him.)  If you do, I will make my name so infamous that it will mar every moment of her life.  It will ruin her, and make her
1085|168|MRS. ERLYNNE.|wretched.  If you dare to tell her, there is no depth of degradation I will not sink to, no pit of shame I will not enter.  You shall not
1086|169|MRS. ERLYNNE.|tell her--I forbid you.
1087|147|LORD WINDERMERE.|Why?
1088|170|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(After a pause.)  If I said to you that I cared for her, perhaps loved her even--you would sneer at me, wouldn't you?
1089|148|LORD WINDERMERE.|I should feel it was not true.  A mother's love means devotion, unselfishness, sacrifice.  What could you know of such things?
1090|171|MRS. ERLYNNE.|You are right.  What could I know of such things? Don't let us talk any more about it--as for telling my daughter who I am, that I do not
1091|172|MRS. ERLYNNE.|allow.  It is my secret, it is not yours.  If I make up my mind to tell her, and I think I will, I shall tell her before I leave the
1092|173|MRS. ERLYNNE.|house--if not, I shall never tell her.
1093|149|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Angrily.)  Then let me beg of you to leave our house at once.  I will make your excuses to Margaret.
1094|0||(Enter LADY WINDERMERE R.  She goes over to MRS. ERLYNNE with the photograph in her hand.  LORD WINDERMERE moves to back of sofa, and
1095|0||anxiously watches MRS. ERLYNNE as the scene progresses.)
1096|239|LADY WINDERMERE.|I am so sorry, Mrs. Erlynne, to have kept you waiting.  I couldn't find the photograph anywhere.  At last I discovered it in my husband's
1097|240|LADY WINDERMERE.|dressing-room--he had stolen it.
1098|174|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Takes the photograph from her and looks at it.)  I am not surprised--it is charming.  (Goes over to sofa with LADY WINDERMERE, and sits
1099|175|MRS. ERLYNNE.|down beside her.  Looks again at the photograph.)  And so that is your little boy!  What is he called?
1100|241|LADY WINDERMERE.|Gerard, after my dear father.
1101|176|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Laying the photograph down.)  Really?
1102|242|LADY WINDERMERE.|Yes.  If it had been a girl, I would have called it after my mother.  My mother had the same name as myself, Margaret.
1103|177|MRS. ERLYNNE.|My name is Margaret too.
1104|243|LADY WINDERMERE.|Indeed!
1105|178|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Yes.  (Pause.)  You are devoted to your mother's memory, Lady Windermere, your husband tells me.
1106|244|LADY WINDERMERE.|We all have ideals in life.  At least we all should have.  Mine is my mother.
1107|179|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Ideals are dangerous things.  Realities are better. They wound, but they're better.
1108|245|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Shaking her head.)  If I lost my ideals, I should lose everything.
1109|180|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Everything?
1110|246|LADY WINDERMERE.|Yes.  (Pause.)
1111|181|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Did your father often speak to you of your mother?
1112|247|LADY WINDERMERE.|No, it gave him too much pain.  He told me how my mother had died a few months after I was born.  His eyes filled with tears as he spoke. 
1113|248|LADY WINDERMERE.|Then he begged me never to mention her name to him again.  It made him suffer even to hear it.  My father- -my father really died of a
1114|249|LADY WINDERMERE.|broken heart.  His was the most ruined life know,
1115|182|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Rising.)  I am afraid I must go now, Lady Windermere.
1116|250|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Rising.)  Oh no, don't.
1117|183|MRS. ERLYNNE.|I think I had better.  My carriage must have come back by this time.  I sent it to Lady Jedburgh's with a note.
1118|251|LADY WINDERMERE.|Arthur, would you mind seeing if Mrs. Erlynne's carriage has come back?
1119|184|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Pray don't trouble, Lord Windermere.
1120|252|LADY WINDERMERE.|Yes, Arthur, do go, please.
1121|0||(LORD WINDERMERE hesitated for a moment and looks at MRS. ERLYNNE. She remains quite impassive.  He leaves the room.)
1122|0||(To MRS. ERLYNNE.)  Oh!  What am I to say to you?  You saved me last night?  (Goes towards her.)
1123|185|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Hush--don't speak of it.
1124|253|LADY WINDERMERE.|I must speak of it.  I can't let you think that I am going to accept this sacrifice.  I am not.  It is too great.  I am going to tell my
1125|254|LADY WINDERMERE.|husband everything.  It is my duty.
1126|186|MRS. ERLYNNE.|It is not your duty--at least you have duties to others besides him.  You say you owe me something?
1127|255|LADY WINDERMERE.|I owe you everything.
1128|187|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Then pay your debt by silence.  That is the only way in which it can be paid.  Don't spoil the one good thing I have done in my life by
1129|188|MRS. ERLYNNE.|telling it to any one.  Promise me that what passed last night will remain a secret between us.  You must not bring misery into your
1130|189|MRS. ERLYNNE.|husband's life.  Why spoil his love?  You must not spoil it.  Love is easily killed.  Oh! how easily love is killed.  Pledge me your word,
1131|190|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Lady Windermere, that you will never tell him.  I insist upon it.
1132|256|LADY WINDERMERE.|(With bowed head.)  It is your will, not mine.
1133|191|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Yes, it is my will.  And never forget your child--I like to think of you as a mother.  I like you to think of yourself as one.
1134|257|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Looking up.)  I always will now.  Only once in my life I have forgotten my own mother--that was last night.  Oh, if I had remembered her I
1135|258|LADY WINDERMERE.|should not have been so foolish, so wicked.
1136|192|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(With a slight shudder.)  Hush, last night is quite over.
1137|0||(Enter LORD WINDERMERE.)
1138|150|LORD WINDERMERE.|Your carriage has not come back yet, Mrs. Erlynne.
1139|193|MRS. ERLYNNE.|It makes no matter.  I'll take a hansom.  There is nothing in the world so respectable as a good Shrewsbury and Talbot.  And now, dear Lady
1140|194|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Windermere, I am afraid it is really good-bye.  (Moves up C.)  Oh, I remember.  You'll think me absurd, but do you know I've taken a great
1141|195|MRS. ERLYNNE.|fancy to this fan that I was silly enough to run away with last night from your ball.  Now, I wonder would you give it to me?  Lord
1142|196|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Windermere says you may.  I know it is his present.
1143|259|LADY WINDERMERE.|Oh, certainly, if it will give you any pleasure. But it has my name on it.  It has 'Margaret' on it.
1144|197|MRS. ERLYNNE.|But we have the same Christian name.
1145|260|LADY WINDERMERE.|Oh, I forgot.  Of course, do have it.  What a wonderful chance our names being the same!
1146|198|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Quite wonderful.  Thanks--it will always remind me of you.  (Shakes hands with her.)
1147|0||(Enter PARKER.)
1148|23|PARKER.|Lord Augustus Lorton.  Mrs. Erlynne's carriage has come.
1149|0||(Enter LORD AUGUSTUS.)
1150|46|LORD AUGUSTUS.|Good morning, dear boy.  Good morning, Lady Windermere.  (Sees MRS. ERLYNNE.)  Mrs. Erlynne!
1151|199|MRS. ERLYNNE.|How do you do, Lord Augustus?  Are you quite well this morning?
1152|47|LORD AUGUSTUS.|(Coldly.)  Quite well, thank you, Mrs. Erlynne.
1153|200|MRS. ERLYNNE.|You don't look at all well, Lord Augustus.  You stop up too late--it is so bad for you.  You really should take more care of yourself. 
1154|201|MRS. ERLYNNE.|Good-bye, Lord Windermere. (Goes towards door with a bow to LORD AUGUSTUS.  Suddenly smiles and looks back at him.)  Lord Augustus!  Won't
1155|202|MRS. ERLYNNE.|you see me to my carriage?  You might carry the fan.
1156|151|LORD WINDERMERE.|Allow me!
1157|203|MRS. ERLYNNE.|No; I want Lord Augustus.  I have a special message for the dear Duchess.  Won't you carry the fan, Lord Augustus?
1158|48|LORD AUGUSTUS.|If you really desire it, Mrs. Erlynne.
1159|204|MRS. ERLYNNE.|(Laughing.)  Of course I do.  You'll carry it so gracefully.  You would carry off anything gracefully, dear Lord Augustus.
1160|0||(When she reaches the door she looks back for a moment at LADY WINDERMERE.  Their eyes meet.  Then she turns, and exit C. followed by LORD
1161|0||AUGUSTUS.)
1162|261|LADY WINDERMERE.|You will never speak against Mrs. Erlynne again, Arthur, will you?
1163|152|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Gravely.)  She is better than one thought her.
1164|262|LADY WINDERMERE.|She is better than I am.
1165|153|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Smiling as he strokes her hair.)  Child, you and she belong to different worlds.  Into your world evil has never entered.
1166|263|LADY WINDERMERE.|Don't say that, Arthur.  There is the same world for all of us, and good and evil, sin and innocence, go through it hand in hand.  To shut
1167|264|LADY WINDERMERE.|one's eyes to half of life that one may live securely is as though one blinded oneself that one might walk with more safety in a land of pit
1168|265|LADY WINDERMERE.|and precipice.
1169|154|LORD WINDERMERE.|(Moves down with her.)  Darling, why do you say that?
1170|266|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Sits on sofa.)  Because I, who had shut my eyes to life, came to the brink.  And one who had separated us -
1171|155|LORD WINDERMERE.|We were never separated.
1172|267|LADY WINDERMERE.|We never must be again.  O Arthur, don't love me less, and I will trust you more.  I will trust you absolutely.  Let us go to Selby.  In the
1173|268|LADY WINDERMERE.|Rose Garden at Selby the roses are white and red.
1174|0||(Enter LORD AUGUSTUS C.)
1175|49|LORD AUGUSTUS.|Arthur, she has explained everything!
1176|0||(LADY WINDERMERE looks horribly frightened at this.  LORD WINDERMERE starts.  LORD AUGUSTUS takes WINDERMERE by the arm and brings him to
1177|0||front of stage.  He talks rapidly and in a low voice. LADY WINDERMERE stands watching them in terror.)  My dear fellow, she has explained
1178|0||every demmed thing.  We all wronged her immensely.  It was entirely for my sake she went to Darlington's rooms.  Called first at the
1179|0||Club--fact is, wanted to put me out of suspense--and being told I had gone on--followed--naturally frightened when she heard a lot of us
1180|0||coming in--retired to another room--I assure you, most gratifying to me, the whole thing.  We all behaved brutally to her.  She is just the
1181|0||woman for me.  Suits me down to the ground.  All the conditions she makes are that we live entirely out of England.  A very good thing too. 
1182|0||Demmed clubs, demmed climate, demmed cooks, demmed everything.  Sick of it all!
1183|269|LADY WINDERMERE.|(Frightened.)  Has Mrs. Erlynne--?
1184|50|LORD AUGUSTUS.|(Advancing towards her with a low bow.)  Yes, Lady Windermere-- Mrs. Erlynne has done me the honour of accepting my hand.
1185|156|LORD WINDERMERE.|Well, you are certainly marrying a very clever woman!
